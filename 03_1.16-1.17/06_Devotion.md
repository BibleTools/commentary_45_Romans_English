# Devotion

Romans 1:16-17 says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, 'The righteous shall live by faith.'"

The theme of this passage is clear: the gospel is the power of God for salvation. Paul says that he is not ashamed of the gospel because it has the power to save everyone who believes, regardless of their background or ethnicity. 

As we reflect on this passage, we may ask ourselves, what is the gospel? The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins and rose again on the third day, conquering death and giving us eternal life. It is the message of salvation that sets us free from sin and death and gives us hope for the future.

Paul's words remind us that the gospel is not just another religious message, but it is the very power of God that can transform our lives. When we believe in Jesus Christ and accept His sacrifice for our sins, we are transformed from the inside out. We are made right with God and given new life in Christ.

But the gospel is not just for our personal salvation. It is a message that we are called to share with others. As followers of Christ, we are called to be ambassadors of the gospel, sharing the love of Christ with those around us. 

So let us not be ashamed of the gospel, but let us boldly proclaim it to a world that desperately needs to hear it. Let us live out our faith with courage and conviction, knowing that the gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

We come before you today with grateful hearts and humble spirits, acknowledging that the gospel is the power of God for salvation. We thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins and rise again on the third day, conquering death and giving us eternal life.

We ask that you would give us the courage and boldness to share the gospel with those around us. Help us to be faithful ambassadors of your love and grace, sharing the message of salvation with those who have yet to hear it.

We pray that the power of the gospel would transform lives and bring hope to those who are lost and hurting. We ask that you would use us to be a light in the darkness, sharing the love of Christ with those who need it most.

Help us to live out our faith with courage and conviction, knowing that the gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. May we never be ashamed of the gospel, but always be willing to share the good news with those around us.

We pray all these things in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

Amen.
