In Romans 1:16-17, Paul's main theme is that the gospel is the power of God for salvation. He asserts that the gospel is the means by which both Jews and Gentiles are saved. This is an important assertion because it counters the idea that salvation is only available to particular people or through particular means. Paul argues that everyone who believes in the gospel of Jesus Christ, regardless of their background or status, will be saved.

Paul emphasizes the importance of faith in the gospel throughout this passage. He says that the gospel reveals the righteousness of God from faith to faith, and that the righteous shall live by faith. This means that it is through faith in the gospel that people are made righteous and are able to live in accordance with God's will.

Furthermore, Paul emphasizes the universality of the gospel message. He says that the gospel is for everyone, both Jews and Gentiles. This is a radical idea because it challenges the notion that the gospel is only for certain people or that it is only available through particular means.

Overall, Paul's message in Romans 1:16-17 is that the gospel is the power of God for salvation and that it is available to all who believe. He emphasizes the importance of faith and the universality of the gospel message, which are key theological concepts that underlie the Christian faith.
