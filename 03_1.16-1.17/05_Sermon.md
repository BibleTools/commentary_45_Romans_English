# Sermon

Dear beloved congregation,

Today, we will be discussing a passage from the book of Romans, chapter 1, verses 16-17. In this passage, Paul writes about the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He writes, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealedâ€”a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'"

Before we dive into the message of this passage, it is important to understand its context. The book of Romans was written by the apostle Paul to the believers in Rome. At the time, there were both Jewish and Gentile believers in the Roman church, and there was tension between the two groups. Paul wrote this letter to address this tension and to provide a clear explanation of the gospel message.

Now, let's turn to the message of the passage. Paul writes that he is not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. This means that the gospel is not just a nice message or a philosophy, but it is the very power of God that can transform lives and bring salvation to all who believe in Jesus Christ.

Furthermore, Paul emphasizes that the gospel reveals the righteousness of God. This righteousness is not something that we can earn through our own efforts or good deeds, but it is a righteousness that comes by faith in Jesus Christ. This means that our salvation is not based on our own works, but on the work of Christ on the cross.

So, what is the message or lesson that we can take away from this passage? Firstly, we must understand that the gospel is not just a message, but it is the power of God that can transform our lives. We must also understand that our salvation is based on faith in Jesus Christ alone, and not on our own works or efforts.

As we look at the world around us, we see many people who are lost and searching for meaning in their lives. But we have the answer - the gospel of Jesus Christ. We must not be ashamed to share this message with others, knowing that it is the power of God that can bring salvation to all who believe.

In conclusion, let us remember that the gospel is the power of God for salvation. Let us not be ashamed to share this message with others, knowing that it has the power to transform lives and bring salvation to all who believe.

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
