# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today we turn to Romans 8:31-39, a passage that reminds us of God's love and the security we have in Christ. Before we dive into the text, let us consider the context in which it was written.

The Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the Romans around 57 AD, while he was in Corinth. He wrote to a diverse group of believers, both Jews and Gentiles, who were facing persecution and struggling with questions about their faith. In this passage, Paul seeks to encourage and reassure them of God's love and faithfulness.

Now let us turn to the passage itself. Paul writes, "What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?" (v. 31) Paul is reminding us that through faith in Christ, we have been reconciled to God and have become his beloved children. Therefore, we can be confident that God is always on our side and will never abandon us.

Paul continues, "He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?" (v. 32) Here, Paul highlights the incredible sacrifice that God made for us by sending his Son to die for our sins. If God was willing to do this for us, then we can trust that he will also provide for all of our needs and give us everything that is good for us.

Paul then asks, "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?" (v. 33) The answer is that no one can, because God has justified us through Christ. Paul goes on to say, "Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died--more than that, who was raised--who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us." (v. 34) Even though we are sinners and fall short of God's glory, we have been saved by grace through faith in Christ. And now, Christ is our advocate, interceding for us before the Father.

Paul concludes this passage with a powerful statement: "For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (v. 38-39) This is the ultimate assurance of our salvation - that nothing in all of creation can separate us from God's love in Christ.

So, what is the message or lesson that we can take away from this passage? First and foremost, we can have confidence in God's love and faithfulness. We can trust that he is always on our side and will never abandon us. Second, we can trust that God will provide for all of our needs and give us everything that is good for us. Third, we can be assured of our salvation through faith in Christ, knowing that we have been justified and reconciled to God.

As we leave here today, let us remember these truths and take comfort in the love and security we have in Christ. Amen.
