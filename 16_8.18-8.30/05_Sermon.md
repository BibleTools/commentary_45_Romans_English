# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today’s scripture reading comes from Romans 8:18-30. In this passage, the Apostle Paul speaks of the future glory that awaits us as believers in Christ. As we consider this text, let us ask ourselves the following questions:

1. What is the context of the passage? Who wrote it, to whom was it written, and what historical or cultural background is important to know?

The book of Romans was written by the Apostle Paul to the Christians in Rome. The city of Rome was a cosmopolitan center of the empire, with a diverse population of Jews and Gentiles. Paul wrote this letter to impart to them the message of the gospel and the implications of life in Christ. In chapter 8, Paul speaks of the hope of salvation that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ.

2. What is the main message or theme of the passage? How does it relate to the overall message of the Bible?

The theme of this passage is the future glory that awaits believers in Christ. Paul assures us that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us. He speaks of the creation itself eagerly awaiting the revealing of the sons of God. He reminds us that we were predestined to be conformed to the image of Christ, and that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.

This passage relates to the overall message of the Bible, which is the plan of God to redeem humanity and restore creation. It reminds us of the hope that we have in Christ, and the promise of eternal life.

3. What is the message or lesson that you want the congregation to take away from the sermon?

The message that I want the congregation to take away from this passage is one of hope and assurance. We live in a world filled with suffering and uncertainty, but as believers in Christ, we have a sure and certain hope of eternal life. We are assured of God’s love and faithfulness, and nothing can separate us from him.

4. How can I make the sermon relevant and applicable to the lives of the congregation members?

I can make the sermon relevant and applicable to the lives of the congregation members by reminding them of the challenges and struggles that they face in their daily lives. I can encourage them to hold onto the hope that they have in Christ, and to trust in God’s promises, even in difficult times.

5. What are some relevant stories, personal experiences, or examples that can be used to illustrate the main points of the sermon?

I can share stories of people who have faced difficult circumstances but who have held onto their faith in Christ and found hope and strength in him. I can also share personal experiences of facing trials and difficulties, and how God has sustained me through them.

6. What are some potential challenges or objections that someone might have to the message of the sermon, and how can those be addressed?

Some potential challenges or objections that someone might have to the message of the sermon include questions about the nature of suffering and why God allows it. These objections can be addressed by acknowledging the reality of suffering and reminding people that God does not cause suffering, but that he is present with us in the midst of it and can use it for our good.

7. Are there any important theological or doctrinal principles that need to be emphasized or clarified in relation to the passage?

One important theological principle that needs to be emphasized in relation to this passage is the doctrine of predestination. Paul speaks of God’s predestination of believers to be conformed to the image of Christ. It is important to clarify that this does not mean that God predestines some to be saved and others to be damned, but rather that God has a plan for our lives and is working all things together for our good. We have free will to choose to follow him or not, but God knows the end from the beginning and is working out his purposes in our lives. 

In conclusion, let us hold fast to the hope that we have in Christ, and trust in his promises of eternal life. May we be encouraged and strengthened by the assurance that nothing can separate us from God’s love. Amen.
