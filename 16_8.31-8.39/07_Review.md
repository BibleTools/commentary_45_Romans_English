# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. Verse 31 asks, "If God is for us, who can be against us?" How does the assurance of God's favor and protection affect our daily lives and our ability to face challenges?
2. In verse 32, Paul asks, "He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us allâ€”how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?" How does this verse help us understand the character of God and His provision for us?
3. Verse 35 asks, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" What are some of the challenges or difficulties that can cause us to doubt God's love and security in Christ? How can we overcome these doubts?
4. In verse 37, Paul declares that "in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us." How does the concept of being "more than conquerors" differ from simply overcoming difficulties or challenges? What does this mean for our daily lives?
5. Finally, in verse 39, Paul affirms that "nothing in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." How should this truth impact our perspective on life and our relationship with God? What does it mean to have an unbreakable bond with God through Christ?
