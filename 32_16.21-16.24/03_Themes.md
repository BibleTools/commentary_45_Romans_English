# Themes

Romans 16:21-24 is the closing section of Paul's letter to the Romans, where he sends greetings to various people in the Roman church through his fellow workers. In this passage, the key themes expressed include:

1. Christian community: The greeting highlights the importance of relationships within the Christian community, as Paul sends greetings to his fellow workers and friends, Timothy and Lucius, and to Jason and Sosipater, whom he identifies as his kinsmen. It shows that the early church was not just a collection of individuals, but a community of believers working together for the Gospel.

2. Gospel proclamation: The passage reveals the focus of Paul's ministry, as he refers to himself as a servant of Christ and emphasizes his commitment to spreading the Gospel. He also acknowledges the role of his fellow workers and expresses gratitude for their support in his mission.

3. God's sovereignty: Paul's closing words in this passage emphasize the sovereignty of God in his mission and in the lives of the believers. He acknowledges God as the source of peace, and emphasizes that all glory belongs to God alone.

Biblical Greek studies help us understand the nuances of the passage and the emphasis placed on certain themes. For example, the use of the word "kinsmen" (suggenēs) in verse 21 highlights the importance of family relationships within the early church. The use of the word "peace" (eirēnē) in verse 20 emphasizes the shalom or wholeness that comes from God.

The theological implications of this passage include the importance of relationships within the church, the centrality of the Gospel message, and the sovereignty of God in all things. It reminds us that we are called to live in community as believers, proclaiming the Gospel and relying on God's sovereignty.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this New Testament passage in various ways. For instance, the word "servant" (doulos) used to describe Paul in verse 21 is reminiscent of Old Testament language used to describe prophets and leaders who serve God. Additionally, the idea of God as the source of peace is found throughout the Old Testament, such as in Isaiah 9:6-7.

The message conveyed in this passage impacts our connection with God by reminding us of the importance of relationships within the church and our commitment to the Gospel message. It also helps us to recognize God's sovereignty in all things and to trust in his plans for our lives.
