# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today, we focus our attention on the final greetings given in the book of Romans, specifically Romans 16:21-24. In these verses, we see Paul acknowledging his dear friends and comrades who have assisted him in spreading the gospel message to the world. 

It is important for us to understand the context of this passage. Paul was writing to the church in Rome, a city that was not unfamiliar with persecution of Christians. Paul was aware of the dangers that awaited him and his companions. However, he persevered, and his heart was full of gratitude for those who supported him in his mission.

In these verses, we see Paul mentioning Timothy, Lucius, Jason, Sosipater, Tertius, Gaius, Erastus, and Quartus. These were individuals who had labored with Paul in the gospel ministry. They were his friends and fellow believers who had dedicated their lives to the service of God. 

What is the main message of this passage? Paul is reminding us of the importance of community and fellowship in the Christian faith. We were not created to live our lives in isolation, but to engage in meaningful relationships with one another. The church is a community of believers who have come together to support one another and to spread the message of Jesus Christ. 

As we reflect on this passage, let us ask ourselves, how can we be like Paul and his friends? How can we serve and support one another in our faith journey? How can we be a light to the world and spread the message of Christ to those around us? 

In conclusion, let us remember that we are not alone in our faith. We have a community of believers who have gone before us and who continue to support and encourage us. Let us take heart in the fact that we are united together in Christ and that we have a mission to spread the love and message of Jesus to all those around us. Amen.
