5. How does Paul's desire to visit Rome demonstrate his commitment to spreading the gospel? What can we learn from his example?
6. What does this passage teach us about the importance of community and fellowship in the Christian life? How can we apply these principles to our own lives?
7. How does Paul's attitude towards the Romans (e.g. his gratitude for their faith, his desire to see them in person) challenge us to think about our own relationships with other believers?
