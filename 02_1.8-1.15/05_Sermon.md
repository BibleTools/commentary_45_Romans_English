# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today, we will be reflecting on the passage found in Romans 1:8-15, where the apostle Paul expresses his strong desire to visit Rome.

To understand the context of this passage, it is important to know that Paul wrote this letter to the Romans while he was in Corinth, around the year AD 57. He wrote to introduce himself and his message to the believers in Rome, whom he had not yet met in person. The letter also served as a theological exposition of the gospel, which Paul wanted to clarify and defend.

In verses 8-15, Paul begins by thanking God for the faith of the Roman believers and their reputation for obedience. He then expresses his longing to visit them, stating that he has often planned to come but has been prevented from doing so. Paul's desire to visit Rome was motivated by a few reasons.

Firstly, Paul wanted to strengthen the faith of the Roman church. He knew that the believers in Rome faced persecution and needed encouragement and support. By visiting them, he could provide them with the spiritual nourishment and guidance they needed to grow in their faith.

Secondly, Paul wanted to preach the gospel to the Romans. He believed that the gospel was the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes and wanted to share it with as many people as possible. He saw Rome as a strategic location to spread the gospel further, as it was a major city and a center of influence.

Lastly, Paul wanted to receive something from the Romans. He hoped to be refreshed by their fellowship and to be supported in his mission to spread the gospel to the Gentiles.

In light of this passage, what message or lesson can we take away from it? One important lesson is the value of Christian fellowship. Paul's desire to visit Rome was not just about preaching and teaching, but also about building relationships and supporting one another in the faith. As believers, we need one another to grow, to be encouraged, and to be accountable.

Another lesson is the importance of being intentional in sharing the gospel. Paul saw his mission as being to all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, or social status. We too should have a heart for sharing the gospel with those around us, and to do so intentionally and strategically.

In conclusion, let us remember the words of the apostle Paul in Romans 1:12, "that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith." May we seek to build up one another in the faith, and to share the gospel boldly and intentionally with those around us.

Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the example of the apostle Paul and his desire to visit the believers in Rome. Help us to value Christian fellowship and to be intentional in sharing the gospel with those around us. May we be mutually encouraged by each other's faith and work together to spread the good news of salvation to all people. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
