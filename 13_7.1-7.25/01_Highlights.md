In Romans 7:1-25, Paul explains the relationship between the law and sin. He starts by using the example of marriage to illustrate how a person is bound by the law only as long as they are alive. He then applies this to the believer's relationship with the law, stating that they have died to the law through the body of Christ so that they can belong to Him.

Paul then goes on to describe the struggle with sin that believers face. He acknowledges that the law is good and holy, but that it cannot save us from sin. In fact, he says that the law actually stirs up sin within us, making us more aware of our sinful nature. This is because the law gives us a clear standard to measure ourselves against, and when we fall short of that standard, we become even more aware of our sinfulness.

Paul then describes the internal conflict that believers experience between their desire to do what is right and their inability to do so because of their sinful nature. He says that he himself struggles with this, doing what he does not want to do and failing to do what he knows is right.

Finally, Paul concludes by acknowledging that the only way out of this struggle is through Christ. He thanks God for the deliverance that comes through Jesus, and he affirms that although he may struggle with sin, he is no longer condemned because of his faith in Christ.
