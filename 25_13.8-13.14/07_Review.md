# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. In verse 8, Paul writes that "the one who loves another has fulfilled the law." What does this mean, and how does it relate to the rest of the passage?
2. The passage mentions several specific commandments, such as "you shall not commit adultery" and "you shall not murder" (v. 9). Why do you think Paul focuses on these particular commandments?
3. In verse 10, Paul writes that "love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." How does this relate to the previous discussion of specific commandments?
4. In verses 11-14, Paul urges his audience to "cast off the works of darkness" and "put on the Lord Jesus Christ." What does he mean by this, and how does it relate to the discussion of love and fulfilling the law?
5. Paul mentions several behaviors that he considers to be "works of darkness," such as orgies and drunkenness (v. 13). Why do you think he includes these specific behaviors, and how do they relate to the broader theme of the passage?
6. Finally, how can we apply the message of this passage to our own lives today? How can we love our neighbors and fulfill the law in our own actions and attitudes?
