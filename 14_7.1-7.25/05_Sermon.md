# Sermon

Good morning everyone,

Today, we are going to discuss an important passage from the book of Romans, specifically chapter 7, verses 1-25. This passage focuses on the relationship between the law and sin.

Firstly, let's talk about the context of the passage. The Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the church in Rome, which at the time was a mixture of Jewish and Gentile believers. In chapter 6, Paul emphasized that believers are no longer slaves to sin but are now slaves to righteousness. He also explained that while grace abounds, believers should not use that as an excuse to sin.

In chapter 7, Paul shifts his focus to the relationship between the law and sin. He explains that the law is good and holy, but sin uses the law to produce more sin. Paul uses his own experience to illustrate this point.

We can see from this passage that the main message or theme is that the law reveals sin, but it cannot save us. Only faith in Jesus Christ can save us from sin and death. The law is necessary because it shows us what is right and wrong, but it cannot give us the power to overcome sin. Only through faith in Christ can we be made righteous.

So, what message or lesson can we take away from this passage? We must understand that the law cannot save us. We cannot earn our salvation through keeping the law. Our salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone. However, the law is still important because it shows us what is right and wrong. It helps us to understand what sin is and how to avoid it.

The message of this sermon is relevant and applicable to our lives because we still struggle with sin. We still need the law to guide us and show us what is right and wrong. At the same time, we must not rely on the law for our salvation. Our salvation comes only through faith in Jesus Christ.

To illustrate this point, let me share a personal experience. When I was younger, I used to think that as long as I kept the 10 commandments, I would be saved. But as I grew older, I realized that I could not keep the law perfectly. I needed a savior. I needed Jesus Christ.

Now, you may be thinking, what about those who rely on the law for their salvation? What about those who believe that keeping the law is enough? We must remember that salvation comes through faith alone. It is important to share this message with those who do not yet know Christ.

In conclusion, we have seen from this passage that the law reveals sin, but it cannot save us. Only faith in Jesus Christ can save us from sin and death. The law is important because it shows us what is right and wrong, but it cannot give us the power to overcome sin. Let us remember that our salvation comes only through faith in Christ. May we continue to rely on him and follow his guidance as we strive to live lives that honor God. Amen.
