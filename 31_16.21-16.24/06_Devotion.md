# Devotion

Romans 16:21-24 reads: "Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen. I Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord. Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus, greet you."

At the end of his letter to the Romans, Paul sends greetings from various individuals who were with him or had sent their regards. These were not just random people, but fellow believers and workers in the church who had a close relationship with Paul.

As we reflect on this passage, we can see that even though Paul was an apostle and had an important role in the early church, he did not work alone. He had a team of people who supported him and worked alongside him. These people were not just his colleagues, but his friends.

Similarly, as Christians, we also need each other. We need fellow believers to encourage and support us in our faith journey. We need friends who will stand with us through the ups and downs of life, and who will be there to pray for us and lift us up when we are down.

Furthermore, just like Paul's friends had specific roles in the church, we all have unique talents and abilities that we can use to serve God and build up His kingdom. We are each an important part of the body of Christ, and we all have a vital role to play.

So let us not underestimate the importance of fellowship and community in our lives as Christians. Let us seek to build deep and meaningful relationships with our brothers and sisters in Christ, and let us use our gifts and talents to serve God and bless others. And may we always remember that we are not alone, but part of a larger family of believers who love and support us. Amen.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

We come before you giving thanks for the wonderful gift of friendship. We thank you for the relationships that you have blessed us with, and for the people in our lives who give us support, encouragement, and joy.

As we read in Romans 16:21-24 about Paul's friends, we are reminded of the value of loyal and devoted companionship. We see how these faithful friends stood by Paul in his ministry, and we pray that we may also be such friends to those around us.

Lord, we ask that you bless our friendships. May we be faithful and devoted, always seeking to serve and support one another, just as Paul's friends did for him. Help us to be there for one another in times of need, and to encourage each other in our faith.

We also pray for those who may be struggling in their friendships. May you bring healing to strained relationships, and may you guide us in the ways that we can restore and strengthen our connections with others.

Thank you for the gift of friendship, Lord. May we always cherish and nurture the bonds that you have given us.

In Jesus' name we pray,
Amen.
