# Application

Romans 11:1-36 is a powerful passage that speaks about God's mercy and Israel's future. The passage begins with Paul asking whether God has rejected Israel, to which he responds that God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Paul goes on to explain that a remnant of Israel has been saved by grace and that the rest have been hardened. However, God's mercy is still available to all, whether Jew or Gentile.

In terms of personal application, this passage teaches us several things. Firstly, we should never give up on people, even if they seem hardened to the gospel. Just as God has not given up on Israel, we should not give up on anyone who has not yet received Christ. We should continue to pray for them and share the gospel with them, trusting in God's mercy and grace.

Secondly, we should remember that salvation is by grace alone. Just as God saved a remnant of Israel by grace, so too are we saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. We cannot earn our salvation through good works or religious observance, but only through faith in Christ.

Thirdly, we should be grateful for God's mercy and grace. As Paul writes in verse 32, "For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all." We all deserve God's judgment for our sin, but God has shown us mercy by sending his Son to die for our sins. We should never take this for granted, but always be thankful for God's love and grace.

Finally, this passage teaches us about the future of Israel. Paul writes that all Israel will be saved, and this is a reminder that God is faithful to his promises. Just as he promised to save Israel, so too will he fulfill his promises to us. We can trust in God's faithfulness and look forward to the day when all things will be made new.
