# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today's passage from Romans 11:1-36 speaks to us about God's mercy and Israel's future. In this passage, we see the apostle Paul reflecting on the relationship between God and the Jewish people, and how, despite their initial rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, God has not abandoned them.

First, let us consider the context of this passage. Paul is writing to the church in Rome, which was made up of both Jewish and Gentile believers. He is addressing the question of whether God has rejected the Jewish people because of their rejection of Jesus. Paul's response is clear: "By no means!... God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew" (Romans 11:1-2).

Paul goes on to explain that, even though many Jews have rejected Jesus, there is still a remnant of faithful believers among them. This, he says, is evidence of God's mercy: "So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace" (Romans 11:5-6).

Furthermore, Paul argues that the Gentile believers should not become arrogant or look down on the Jewish people because of their unbelief. Instead, they should be grateful for the opportunity to be grafted into the people of God: "So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you" (Romans 11:20-21).

So what is the main message or theme of this passage? It is God's mercy and faithfulness. Despite the unbelief and rejection of many of the Jewish people, God has not given up on them. He has chosen a remnant of faithful believers among them and will continue to work in their lives to bring about their salvation. This is a message of hope and encouragement for both Jewish and Gentile believers alike.

But what is the message or lesson that we can take away from this passage? I believe it is this: we should never give up on anyone, no matter how far they may seem from God. Just as God has not given up on the Jewish people, we should not give up on those who have not yet come to faith. We should continue to pray for them, love them, and share the gospel with them, trusting in God's mercy and faithfulness to bring about their salvation.

How can we make this message relevant and applicable to our lives today? We can start by examining our own attitudes towards those who are different from us. Do we look down on them? Do we write them off as unreachable? Or do we see them as potential recipients of God's mercy and grace? Let us ask God to give us a heart of compassion and a willingness to share the love of Christ with all who need it.

In conclusion, let us remember that God's mercy and faithfulness are not limited to any one group of people. He loves all of us and desires that all should come to a knowledge of the truth. Let us be faithful in sharing that truth with others, trusting in God's power to bring about transformation and salvation.

Amen.
