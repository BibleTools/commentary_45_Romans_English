# Context

Romans 5:12-21 is a passage that speaks to the struggles that early Christians faced in the time of its writing, and an understanding of its historical and cultural context can help us to better interpret its meaning. The passage begins by stating that sin entered into the world through one man, Adam, and as a result, death came to all people. This idea of original sin was a common belief in Jewish thought, and Paul uses it to explain the human predicament and the need for redemption through Christ.

In the context of early Christianity, believers faced various challenges such as persecution, social ostracism, and pressure to conform to the dominant Roman culture. Many early Christians were Jews who were familiar with the Old Testament scriptures and Jewish traditions. However, they were often at odds with their fellow Jews who rejected Jesus as the Messiah.

The passage in Romans 5 sheds light on the Jewish context of early Christianity. Paul's use of Adam as a representative of all humanity is rooted in Jewish thought, where Adam was seen as the father of all humanity. In Jewish tradition, the sin of Adam was believed to have corrupted human nature and introduced death into the world.

Paul contrasts Adam with Christ, who he describes as the "new Adam" who offers redemption and justification to all who believe in him. This contrast between Adam and Christ would have been significant to Jewish Christians who were familiar with the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

Furthermore, Paul's emphasis on grace and faith as the means of salvation would have been a departure from the legalistic tendencies of Jewish thought at the time. The Jewish religion emphasized obedience to the law as the means of salvation, but Paul argues that salvation is a gift of grace through faith in Christ.

In conclusion, an understanding of the historical and cultural context of Romans 5:12-21 helps us to see how the struggles of early Christians influenced Paul's writing. The passage speaks to the challenge of reconciling Jewish traditions with the message of salvation through Christ. Paul's use of Adam and Christ as representatives of humanity and his emphasis on grace and faith highlight the distinctiveness of Christian thought in contrast to Jewish legalism.
