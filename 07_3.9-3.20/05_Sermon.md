# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today, we will be examining the passage from Romans 3:9-20, which highlights the conclusion that all are guilty before God. This passage is written by the apostle Paul to the Romans, and it provides important context for understanding the nature of sin and the need for salvation in Christ.

First, we must understand the context of this passage. Paul is addressing the Romans, a diverse community of Jews and Gentiles, and he is seeking to demonstrate that all people are in need of salvation because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Paul argues that both Jews and Gentiles are guilty before God because they have failed to keep God's law perfectly, and therefore they cannot earn salvation through their own efforts.

The main message or theme of this passage is that all people are guilty before God, and that no one is righteous on their own. This message is central to the overall message of the Bible, which teaches that we are all sinners in need of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The passage emphasizes the universality of sin and the need for all people to repent and turn to God for forgiveness.

The message or lesson that I want the congregation to take away from this sermon is that we are all sinners in need of salvation, and that we cannot earn our way into heaven by our own efforts. We need to recognize the extent of our guilt before God and turn to Him in humble repentance, seeking His mercy and forgiveness. We must remember that salvation is a gift of grace, given freely to all who believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.

To make this sermon relevant and applicable to the lives of the congregation members, I will use relevant stories and personal experiences to illustrate the main points of the sermon. We all have a tendency to think of ourselves as relatively good people, but the truth is that we are all guilty before God. We need to be honest about our sinfulness and seek God's forgiveness, rather than relying on our own efforts to earn salvation.

There may be some challenges or objections to the message of this sermon, such as the belief that some people are inherently better than others or that good deeds can earn us salvation. However, we must remember that the Bible teaches that all people are sinners in need of salvation, and that our good deeds cannot make up for our sinfulness. We must also be careful not to judge others, but to focus on our own need for repentance and forgiveness.

In conclusion, the passage from Romans 3:9-20 reminds us that we are all guilty before God and in need of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. As we reflect on this message, let us turn to God in repentance and faith, seeking His forgiveness and the gift of eternal life. May we always remember that salvation is a gift of grace, and that we can never earn it through our own efforts. Amen.
