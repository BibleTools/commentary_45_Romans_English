In Romans 16:17-20, Paul gives final instructions and warnings to the Christians in Rome. He urges them to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles to the teachings they have received. He advises that the believers should avoid such people, as they do not serve the Lord but their own interests. 

Paul highlights the importance of being wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil. He emphasizes that God will soon crush Satan under their feet, and they must remain steadfast in their faith until the end.

The biblical Greek words used in this passage provide insights that aid our understanding. For example, the word "skopein" translates to "watch out" or "keep an eye on," indicating the need for vigilance and awareness of potential threats to the community. The word "stumbling block" or "obstacle," "proskomma," emphasizes the need to protect the unity of the church and avoid any teachings or behaviors that could lead to division.

The key phrase "be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil" highlights the importance of discernment and moral clarity in the face of temptation and deception. It reminds us of the need to cultivate a deep understanding of God's will and the wisdom to apply it in our daily lives.

Finally, this passage relates to other passages in the Bible, such as 1 Corinthians 15:58, which emphasizes the need to remain steadfast in faith until the end. It also echoes the theme of spiritual warfare found in Ephesians 6:10-18, emphasizing the importance of standing firm against the enemy's schemes.
