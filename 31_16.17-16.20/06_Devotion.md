Dear beloved,

As we come to the end of the book of Romans, Paul offers us some final instructions and warnings that are still relevant to us today. In Romans 16:17-20, Paul urges us to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in our way that are contrary to the teaching we have learned. This is a warning about false teachers and those who would seek to lead us astray from the truth.

Paul reminds us that these false teachers are not serving Christ but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive. We must be vigilant and discerning when it comes to those who claim to be serving God but are actually leading people away from Him.

So how do we apply this warning to our own lives? First, we need to be rooted in God's Word and have a solid understanding of what it teaches. This will help us recognize false teaching when we hear it. We also need to be in fellowship with other believers who can help us stay on track and hold us accountable.

Second, we must be careful not to be swayed by smooth talking or flattery. False teachers often use persuasive language to make their message sound attractive, but we must remember that just because something sounds good, it doesn't necessarily mean it is true.

Finally, we need to be prayerful and ask God to give us wisdom and discernment when it comes to discerning false teaching. We should also pray for those who are being led astray, that they may come to know the truth and be saved.

Let us heed Paul's warning and be on guard against false teaching. Let us hold fast to the truth of God's Word and be vigilant in discerning the spirits. May God give us the wisdom and discernment we need to stay on the right path and lead others to the truth.

Let us pray:

Dear Lord,

We come before you with hearts full of gratitude and a desire to learn from your word. As we meditate on the passage in Romans 16:17-20, we ask for your guidance and wisdom.

Lord, we pray for the strength to remain steadfast in our faith, even in the face of opposition. Help us to recognize and avoid those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have taught us. Grant us the discernment to distinguish between genuine and false teachers.

We ask that you protect us from evil and give us the courage to stand firm in our beliefs. May we be filled with your love, grace, and peace as we continue to follow you.

Thank you for your word, which encourages, instructs, and guides us in all aspects of our lives. We pray that we may always be faithful to you and live in accordance with your will.

In Jesus' name, we pray.

Amen.
