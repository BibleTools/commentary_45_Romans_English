# Highlights

In Romans 4:1-25, the apostle Paul highlights Abraham as the father of faith. He explains that Abraham was justified by faith, not by works. Paul cites the example of Abraham's faith in God's promise to give him a son, even though he and Sarah were both beyond the age of childbearing.

Paul emphasizes that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness, not because of any action he took, but because of his belief in God's promise. This faith was not just for Abraham's benefit, but it was also a model for all believers to follow.

The passage also highlights how faith is not just for the Jewish people, but it is for all people. Paul explains that Abraham was declared righteous before he was circumcised, which means that faith is not dependent on circumcision or any other religious ritual. This means that both Jews and Gentiles can be justified by faith.

Another key concept in this passage is that faith is not just a one-time event, but it is a lifelong journey. Paul explains that Abraham's faith continued to grow even in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances. Abraham's faith was not just a mental belief, but it was also reflected in his actions and obedience to God.

In summary, Romans 4:1-25 highlights Abraham as the father of faith and emphasizes the importance of faith in salvation. It emphasizes that faith is not dependent on works or religious rituals, but it is a lifelong journey of belief and obedience to God.
