# Sermon

My dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today, we will be reflecting on the story of Abraham, the father of faith. In Romans 4:1-25, Paul discusses how Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness. This passage is not only important for understanding the story of Abraham, but it also sheds light on the concept of faith and righteousness.

First, let us examine the context of this passage. Abraham was a man chosen by God to be the father of a great nation. However, he and his wife Sarah were childless and beyond the age of childbearing. Despite this, Abraham had faith in God’s promise that he would be the father of many nations. In Genesis 15:6, it says, “And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.”

Now, let us move on to the main message or theme of this passage. Paul emphasizes that Abraham’s righteousness was not earned by his good works, but it was credited to him by faith. This is an important concept to understand because, as Christians, we are not saved by our own efforts, but by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ. In verse 5, Paul says, “And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.”

The message or lesson that I want you to take away from this sermon is that salvation is a gift from God that cannot be earned by good works alone. We must have faith in God and in his promises, just as Abraham did. This faith will result in a changed life, characterized by good works and obedience to God’s will.

Now, how can we make this message relevant and applicable to our lives today? We live in a world that values success and achievement based on our own efforts. We are taught to work hard and earn our way to the top. However, this mentality does not apply to our salvation. We cannot earn our salvation through our own efforts, but it is a gift from God that we must receive by faith.

To illustrate this point, let me share with you a personal experience. When I was younger, I used to think that being a good person and doing good works was enough to earn my way to heaven. However, I later realized that salvation was not about what I could do, but about what Jesus had already done for me on the cross. This realization changed my perspective on life and gave me a newfound joy and peace that I had never experienced before.

In conclusion, let us remember that we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Like Abraham, let us have faith in God’s promises, knowing that he is faithful and just. As we live our lives, let us strive to do good works and obey God’s will, not to earn our salvation, but as a sign of our gratitude and love for him. May God bless you all. Amen.
