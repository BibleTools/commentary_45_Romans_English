Romans 4:1-25 tells the story of Abraham, a man who lived by faith and not by sight. Abraham was called by God to leave his home and go to a place that God would show him. Although he did not know where he was going, Abraham trusted God and followed Him without hesitation. In return for his faith, God promised to make him the father of many nations and to bless him and his descendants.

Abraham's faith was not just a one-time decision, but a lifelong journey. He faced many challenges and obstacles along the way, but he continued to trust in God's promises. Even when it seemed impossible for him and his elderly wife Sarah to have children, Abraham believed in God's power and faithfulness. And when God did fulfill His promise and gave them a son, Isaac, Abraham showed his faith by being willing to sacrifice him in obedience to God.

Abraham's story reminds us that faith is not just a feeling or a belief, but an active decision to trust in God's promises and obey His commands. We too will face challenges and obstacles in our lives, but we must choose to trust in God's power and faithfulness. We may not always know where God is leading us or what He has planned for us, but we can be confident that He is always with us and will never leave us.

One theme that stands out in this passage is the importance of faith in God's promises. Abraham's faith in God's promise to make him the father of many nations was credited to him as righteousness. This means that his faith was counted as righteousness before God. We too can be counted as righteous before God if we have faith in His promises and trust in His power to fulfill them.

As we reflect on Abraham's story, let us ask ourselves: Do we have the same kind of faith that Abraham had? Are we willing to trust in God's promises even when they seem impossible? Let us pray that God will increase our faith and help us to trust Him more each day. May we be like Abraham, the father of faith, and live by faith and not by sight.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

As we read and reflect on the story of Abraham, the father of faith, we are reminded of the importance of trusting in Your promises and obeying Your commands. Help us to have the same kind of faith that Abraham had, a faith that was counted as righteousness before You.

Lord, we know that we will face challenges and obstacles in our lives, but help us to choose to trust in Your power and faithfulness. When we don't know where You are leading us or what You have planned for us, help us to be confident that You are always with us and will never leave us.

We pray that You would increase our faith and help us to trust You more each day. Help us to be obedient to Your commands, even when they may seem difficult or impossible. And may our faith in You be counted as righteousness before You.

Thank You for the example of Abraham, who lived by faith and not by sight. Help us to follow in his footsteps and trust in You with all of our hearts.

In Jesus' precious name we pray, Amen.
