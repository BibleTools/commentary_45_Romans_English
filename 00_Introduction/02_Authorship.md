Author: The book of Romans in the New Testament was written by the apostle Paul.

Time of writing: Paul wrote the book of Romans in the late 50s AD, during his third missionary journey.

Background and circumstances: At the time of writing, Paul had never visited the church in Rome, but he had heard about their faith and wanted to encourage them. He wrote the letter to the Romans to explain the gospel in more detail and to address some specific issues that were present in the church. The book of Romans is considered to be one of the most important theological writings in the New Testament, as it addresses topics such as sin, salvation, and justification by faith. The book also emphasizes the importance of living a life of obedience to God and being transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit.
