# Context

Romans 2:1-29 is a section of the book that addresses the issue of the guilt of the Jews. It is important to consider the historical context of this passage to better understand the struggles that early Christians faced at the time of its writing. 

At the time Romans was written, the Christian community was still primarily made up of Jewish believers, and there was a growing tension between Jewish and Gentile Christians. The Jews struggled with the idea that Gentiles were being welcomed into the Christian community without having to follow Jewish laws, while the Gentile Christians were struggling to understand the Jewish cultural and religious practices.

The passage begins with Paul addressing the Jewish community, reminding them that they too are guilty of sin and cannot judge others. This was a significant message, as many Jews believed that they were superior to Gentiles because they were God's chosen people and had the Law. Paul was challenging this belief and pointing out that they were equally guilty of sin.

He then goes on to explain that it is not just hearing the Law that makes someone righteous, but rather it is living according to it. This message was important for the Jewish community, who believed that simply having the Law was enough to make them righteous.

Paul also addresses the issue of circumcision, which was a contentious issue for Jewish and Gentile Christians. He explains that circumcision is not what matters, but rather it is the circumcision of the heart that makes one a true Jew.

Throughout this passage, Paul is challenging the idea of Jewish superiority and pointing out that all are guilty of sin and in need of God's grace. This message would have been difficult for the Jewish community to hear, as it challenged their beliefs and cultural practices.

In summary, the historical context of this passage reveals the struggles that early Christians faced in reconciling Jewish and Gentile beliefs and practices. Paul's message challenges the notion of Jewish superiority and calls all to live according to the Law and be circumcised in the heart. Understanding this context helps to better interpret the meaning of the passage and its relevance for Christians today.
