Romans 2:1-29 speaks about the guilt of the Jews. Paul begins by addressing those who judge others, reminding them that they are just as guilty of sin as those they judge. He states that God will judge everyone according to their deeds, whether Jew or Gentile.

Paul then goes on to explain that the Jews, who have the Law, are not exempt from judgment. He points out that it is not enough to simply possess the Law, but it must be obeyed. He warns that those who do not obey will be judged just as harshly as those who do not have the Law.

Paul also addresses the issue of circumcision, which was an important symbol of Jewish identity. He explains that true circumcision is not a physical act but a matter of the heart. Those who are truly circumcised in heart will receive praise from God, not from men.

Paul concludes the passage by emphasizing that being a Jew is not just a matter of outward observance, but also of inward transformation. He points out that true circumcision and true obedience come from the heart, not from external rituals or observances.

The insight from the biblical Greek words in this passage is that Paul uses the term "judgment" (krima) 8 times, emphasizing the importance of judgment and the fact that both Jews and Gentiles will be judged. He also uses the term "circumcision" (peritome) 7 times, showing the significance of the circumcision symbol in Jewish identity and emphasizing its true meaning as a matter of the heart.

This passage relates to other passages in the Bible, such as Matthew 23:27-28, which talks about the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, and Galatians 5:6, which emphasizes the importance of faith and love over external rituals. Overall, Paul's message in Romans 2 is that both Jews and Gentiles are guilty of sin and need salvation, which can only come through faith in Christ.
