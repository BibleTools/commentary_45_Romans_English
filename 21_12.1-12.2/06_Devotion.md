Romans 12:1-2 says, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."

This passage is a powerful call to all believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices to God. It's important to understand that this is not a call to physical sacrifice or self-harm, but rather a call to dedicate our entire beings – body, mind, and soul – to God's will and purpose.

As we reflect on this passage, we must ask ourselves: what are the things in our lives that we are holding back from God? Are we truly offering ourselves as living sacrifices, or are we holding onto parts of ourselves for our own selfish desires and wants?

The passage also reminds us that we are not to conform to the patterns of this world. This can be a challenge, as our culture often promotes values and priorities that are not aligned with God's will. But as we seek to be transformed by the renewing of our minds, we can begin to discern God's will and purpose for our lives.

What does it mean to have a renewed mind? It means that we are constantly seeking to align our thoughts and actions with God's will. We are not content to simply go along with the trends and values of the world around us, but we are actively seeking to live in a way that honors and pleases God.

The call to be a living sacrifice is not an easy one, but it is a necessary one. As we offer ourselves to God, we are transformed and made new. We are able to discern God's will and purpose for our lives, and we are empowered to live in a way that brings honor and glory to Him.

Let us pray:

Dear God,

As I come before you today, I offer myself as a living sacrifice. I lay down my own desires, my own will, and my own plans, and I ask that you take control of my life. I want to honor you in everything that I do, and I want to live a life that is pleasing to you.

Help me to renew my mind daily so that I can discern your will for my life. Guide me as I seek to follow your path and live a life that is holy and acceptable to you. Give me the strength and courage to resist the temptations of this world and to stay true to your Word.

I pray that my life will be a testimony to your goodness and grace. Use me for your glory, and help me to serve others with a heart of love and compassion. I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
