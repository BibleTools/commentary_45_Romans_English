# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. In verse 1, Paul urges the believers to offer themselves as "living sacrifices." What do you think this means? How does it differ from the sacrificial system of the Old Testament?
2. What does it mean to be "holy and pleasing to God"? In what ways can we strive to be holy and pleasing to Him?
3. What does it mean to "not conform to the pattern of this world"? Can you give some examples of how we can avoid conforming to the world's pattern?
4. How can we "be transformed by the renewing of our mind"? What are some practical steps we can take to renew our minds?
5. In verse 2, Paul encourages the believers to test and approve what God's will is. How can we determine God's will for our lives? What role does prayer and seeking wise counsel play in this process?
6. In what ways can we resist the pressure to conform to the world's values? How can we live as "living sacrifices" in a culture that opposes God's ways?
7. How can we apply this passage in our daily lives? What practical steps can we take to live as "living sacrifices" and renew our minds to God's truth?
