Romans 12:1-2 calls for believers to offer their bodies as "a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God." This means that rather than offering animal sacrifices as was done in the Old Testament, believers are to offer themselves as a sacrifice to God. This sacrifice involves a complete dedication of one's life, thoughts, and actions to God's will.

The passage emphasizes the importance of renewing one's mind to discern God's will. This is accomplished through the transformation of our thinking, which is a continual process throughout our lives. By being transformed, we are able to discern what is good and pleasing to God, and we are able to live accordingly.

The Greek word for "transformed" is "metamorphoo," which implies a complete and radical change. This transformation is only possible through the power of the Holy Spirit, and it results in a life that is pleasing to God.

This passage also emphasizes the importance of unity in the body of Christ. Believers are called to use their unique gifts and abilities to serve one another and to build up the body of Christ.

Overall, this passage calls believers to live a life of sacrifice, focused on discerning and following God's will, and serving one another in unity.
