# Sermon

Dear congregation,

Today we are going to explore the passage of Romans 12:1-2, which discusses the idea of offering ourselves as living sacrifices to God. This passage was written by the apostle Paul to the church in Rome, and it is important to understand the context and background of this message.

First, we must understand that Paul was writing during a time when the Roman Empire was the dominant power in the world, and Christianity was a minority religion. The believers in Rome faced persecution and discrimination, and Paul wanted to encourage them to continue living in faith and offering themselves fully to God.

In this passage, Paul urges us to offer our bodies as living sacrifices to God, which means that our entire being, our thoughts, actions, and desires should be dedicated to God. This is not a one-time sacrifice, but a continuous process of surrendering ourselves to God's will and purpose.

The main message of this passage is that as Christians, we are called to live differently from the world around us. We are called to be transformed by the renewing of our minds, which means that we must reject the values and attitudes of the world and embrace the values and attitudes of God. We are not to conform to the patterns of this world, but to be transformed by the power of God.

The lesson that we can take from this passage is that true worship and service to God requires a wholehearted commitment to him. It requires us to lay down our own desires and submit to God's will. It requires us to put God first in every aspect of our lives, and to serve him with a pure and humble heart.

To make this message relevant and applicable to our lives, we must ask ourselves, what are the things in our lives that we are holding back from God? What are the areas in our lives where we are not fully surrendered? We must be honest with ourselves and with God, and ask him to help us to fully offer ourselves as living sacrifices to him.

In conclusion, let us remember that offering ourselves as living sacrifices to God is not just a religious activity or duty, but a way of life. It is a continuous process of submitting our minds, our hearts, and our bodies to God's will. Let us seek God's help and guidance as we strive to live as true disciples of Christ. Amen.
