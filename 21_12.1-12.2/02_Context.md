# Context

Romans 12:1-2 says, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."

This passage is written by the Apostle Paul in the book of Romans to a community of Christians in Rome. At the time, Christians faced persecution and discrimination from the Roman government and society at large. Paul is urging the Christians to live a life that is holy and pleasing to God, which may involve sacrifice and suffering.

Paul's use of the term "living sacrifice" is significant in this context. In Jewish culture, sacrifices were a common way of atoning for sins and seeking God's forgiveness. However, sacrifices typically involved the killing of an animal. The idea of a "living sacrifice" implies a willingness to offer oneself as a sacrifice for God's purposes while still remaining alive.

This passage also speaks to the struggles that early Christians faced in terms of conforming to the pattern of the world. The Roman Empire was known for its immorality and idolatry, and it would have been challenging for Christians to resist these influences. Paul urges the Christians to be transformed by the renewing of their minds, which involves a radical transformation of their values, beliefs, and behaviors.

Finally, the historical and cultural context helps us to understand the significance of Paul's call to offer oneself as a living sacrifice. In the Roman Empire, power and wealth were highly valued, and sacrificing oneself for a cause was seen as foolish and weak. Paul is urging the Christians to reject these values and instead prioritize their commitment to God, even if it means sacrificing their own comfort, safety, or reputation.

In summary, Romans 12:1-2 speaks to the struggles that early Christians faced in terms of persecution, societal pressure to conform to worldly values, and the need to offer oneself as a living sacrifice for God's purposes. Understanding the historical and cultural context helps us to better appreciate the radical nature of Paul's call to holy living and self-sacrifice.
