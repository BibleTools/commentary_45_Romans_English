# Sermon

Dear beloved congregation,

Today's passage comes from Romans 6:15-23, which speaks about being slaves of righteousness. Before we dive into the message of this passage, let us briefly review the context. The letter to the Romans was written by the Apostle Paul to the Christians in Rome. At the time, the Roman Empire was a dominant force, and the spread of Christianity was met with opposition and persecution. In his letter, Paul seeks to clarify the gospel message and encourage the believers in Rome to live out their faith.

In Romans 6:15-23, Paul addresses a common question that arises when we talk about grace: "What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace?" Paul answers this question emphatically: "By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?"

The main message of this passage is that we are called to be slaves of righteousness. This means that we are to live a life that is obedient to God and His commands. We are to seek His will and His glory in all that we do. We cannot continue to live in sin while claiming the grace of God.

As Christians, we are no longer slaves to sin, but slaves to righteousness. We have been set free from the power of sin and death through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We are now called to live a life that is pleasing to God, and to walk in the newness of life that He has given us.

The message or lesson that I want you to take away from this sermon is that we must choose to be slaves of righteousness. We cannot continue to live in sin and expect to experience the fullness of life that God has promised us. We must turn away from our old ways and embrace the new life that Christ has given us.

To make this message relevant and applicable to your lives, think about the areas in your life where you struggle with sin. Are there habits or behaviors that you need to let go of? Are there relationships that are leading you away from God? Identify these areas and ask God to help you to be a slave of righteousness in those areas.

In closing, let us remember that as slaves of righteousness, we are called to live a life that is pleasing to God. Let us turn away from sin and embrace the new life that Christ has given us. May God grant us the strength and grace to be faithful servants of His kingdom. Amen.
