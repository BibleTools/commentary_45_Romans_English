# Sermon

Dear congregation,

Today, we will reflect on a passage from Romans 15:1-13, which emphasizes following the example of Christ. This passage was written by Paul to the church in Rome, and it contains important messages that are still relevant to us today.

Firstly, we need to understand the context of this passage. Paul is addressing the issue of disagreements among believers on matters that are not central to their faith. He reminds the Roman church that the strong should bear with the weak and not please themselves but do what is helpful to others. This is because Christ did not please himself but rather gave himself for the sake of others.

This leads us to the main message of the passage: that we, as followers of Christ, should follow his example of selflessness and humility. We should not seek to please ourselves but rather seek to serve others. This message is crucial for us as we strive to live a life that is pleasing to God.

The lesson that we should take away from this passage is that we should put the needs of others before our own desires. We should be willing to sacrifice our own comfort for the sake of others, just as Christ did for us. This is especially relevant in our current society, where individualism and self-centeredness are often promoted.

To make this message relevant and applicable to our lives, we need to ask ourselves, "How can I be more like Christ in my interactions with others?" We need to look for opportunities to serve others and put their needs before our own. This could be as simple as making time for a friend in need or volunteering in our community.

To illustrate this main point, let me share a personal story. Recently, I was at a grocery store, and I saw an elderly woman struggling to reach an item on a high shelf. Instead of ignoring her, I offered to help, and she was grateful for my assistance. This small act of kindness helped her and made me feel good about serving her.

However, we should also recognize that following Christ's example of selflessness can be challenging. Some may object that it is not fair to always put others before ourselves. But we must remember that Christ's love for us was not based on fairness, but on grace.

Furthermore, we should emphasize the theological principle that Christ's selflessness on the cross was the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. By following Christ's example, we are not only serving others, but we are also reflecting the love of Christ to the world.

In conclusion, let us strive to follow Christ's example of selflessness and humility. Let us put the needs of others before our own desires and look for opportunities to serve those around us. By doing so, we can reflect the love of Christ to the world and live a life that is pleasing to God. Amen.
