# Themes

The key themes expressed in Romans 3:21-31 include:

1. The righteousness of God: This passage emphasizes how God's righteousness is revealed through faith in Jesus Christ, rather than through obedience to the law. This theme is closely tied to the idea of justification, which means being declared righteous in God's sight.

2. Justification by faith: The passage emphasizes that all people, both Jews and Gentiles, are justified by faith in Jesus Christ, apart from the works of the law. This means that salvation is a free gift from God, received through faith, rather than something that can be earned through good deeds.

3. The role of the law: Although the passage emphasizes that salvation is not achieved through obedience to the law, it also highlights the importance of the law in revealing our sin and our need for a savior.

Biblical Greek studies can help us to understand the nuances of some of the key terms in this passage. For example, the word translated as "righteousness" (dikaiosune) is closely related to the word for "justice" or "judgment." This emphasizes that God's righteousness is not just a matter of moral perfection, but also involves his role as the judge of the universe. Additionally, the Greek word for "faith" (pistis) can also carry connotations of loyalty or fidelity, highlighting the aspect of trust and commitment that is involved in faith in Jesus Christ.

An illustration that can help us understand this passage is the image of a courtroom. In this metaphor, God is the judge, and we are all on trial for our sins. The law acts as the standard by which our guilt is measured. However, because we all fall short of that standard, we are all deserving of punishment. The good news is that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can be declared righteous, not because of anything we have done, but because of what Christ has done for us. It's like Jesus steps in and pays the penalty for our crimes, so that we can go free.

The theological implications of this passage are profound. It emphasizes that salvation is entirely a work of God's grace, received through faith in Jesus Christ. It also highlights the unity of the people of God, both Jews and Gentiles, who are all justified by the same faith. Additionally, it shows how the law functions as a teacher, revealing our sin and our need for a savior.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this passage in a number of ways. For example, Psalm 14:1-3 and Psalm 53:1-3 both emphasize the universality of human sinfulness, which is a key point in Romans 3:23-24. Additionally, the story of Abraham in Genesis 15:6 is cited in Romans 4 as an example of how faith was credited to him as righteousness. This underscores the importance of faith, rather than works, in our relationship with God.

Finally, the message conveyed in this passage can have a powerful impact on our connection with God. It reminds us that we are all sinners in need of God's grace, and that salvation is not something we can achieve on our own. It also encourages us to place our trust in Jesus Christ, who has already paid the price for our sins. This can lead to a deeper sense of gratitude and devotion to God, as well as a desire to live in a way that pleases him.
