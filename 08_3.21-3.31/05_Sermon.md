# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters,

Today's sermon will focus on one of the most important and fundamental concepts in the Bible - the righteousness of God through faith. Our passage today is Romans 3:21-31.

First, let's explore the context of this passage. The apostle Paul wrote this letter to the Roman church to explain the gospel of Jesus Christ and its relevance to both Jews and Gentiles. In the first three chapters, Paul establishes that all people - both Jews and Gentiles - have sinned and fallen short of God's glory. No one is righteous by their own efforts or works.

But, in verses 21-31, Paul reveals the good news of the gospel - that the righteousness of God is available to all people through faith in Jesus Christ. This righteousness is not earned by our own works or efforts, but rather it is a gift from God that we receive by faith.

The main message or theme of this passage is that we are justified - made right with God - by faith in Jesus Christ. This justification is not based on our own merit, but rather it is a result of God's grace and mercy. This theme is central to the overall message of the Bible - that we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.

So, what is the message or lesson that we can take away from this passage? The message is that salvation is available to all people, regardless of their background, ethnicity, or social status. It is a free gift from God that we receive by faith in Jesus Christ. We cannot earn this salvation by our own works or efforts, but rather we must trust in Jesus and his finished work on the cross.

How can we make this sermon relevant and applicable to our lives? We can apply this message by recognizing our own sinfulness and our need for a savior. We can turn to Jesus in faith and trust him to save us. We can also share this message with others who do not yet know Jesus, so that they too can experience the righteousness of God through faith.

To illustrate this message, let me share a personal experience. I, like all of us, have sinned and fallen short of God's glory. But, when I turned to Jesus in faith, I experienced the forgiveness and righteousness that he offers. It was not because of anything I had done, but because of what he had done for me. This is the message of the gospel - that we can be made right with God through faith in Jesus Christ.

Finally, let us address any potential challenges or objections that someone might have to this message. Some might argue that we can earn our way to heaven through good works or religious practices. But, as we have seen in this passage and throughout the Bible, salvation is a gift from God that we receive by faith in Jesus Christ alone.

In conclusion, brothers and sisters, let us hold fast to the truth that we are justified by faith in Jesus Christ. Let us trust in him alone for our salvation and share this good news with others. May the righteousness of God through faith be a reality in our lives and in the lives of those around us. Amen.
