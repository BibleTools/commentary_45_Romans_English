Romans 8:18-30 is a powerful passage that speaks about the future glory that awaits those who believe in Jesus Christ. It is a passage that provides hope and encouragement to believers, especially during times of suffering and trials. In this passage, Paul speaks about three important things: the present sufferings of believers, the future glory that awaits them, and the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives.

Firstly, Paul talks about the present sufferings of believers. He acknowledges that the present sufferings that believers face are real and can be intense. He describes these sufferings as "the sufferings of this present time" (v. 18). These sufferings can include physical pain, emotional distress, and even persecution for their faith. However, Paul reminds us that these sufferings are temporary and will not compare to the glory that awaits us in the future.

Secondly, Paul speaks about the future glory that awaits believers. He says that "the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us" (v. 18). This future glory includes the redemption of our bodies, which means that we will receive new glorified bodies that will never experience pain, sickness, or death. This future glory also includes our inheritance as children of God and our eternal life with Him in the new heaven and new earth.

Lastly, Paul emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. He says that the Holy Spirit helps believers in their weakness and intercedes for them in prayer. The Holy Spirit also helps believers to live a life that is pleasing to God and to grow in their relationship with Him. The Holy Spirit gives us the strength and power to overcome our present sufferings and to persevere until we receive the future glory that awaits us.

So how can we apply the teachings of Romans 8:18-30 to our daily lives? Firstly, we can have hope and perseverance in the midst of our present sufferings, knowing that they are temporary and will not compare to the glory that awaits us. Secondly, we can live our lives with an eternal perspective, knowing that our ultimate destiny is with God in the new heaven and new earth. Finally, we can rely on the Holy Spirit to help us overcome our weaknesses and to grow in our relationship with God. By doing so, we can experience the joy and peace that comes from knowing that our future is secure in Christ.
