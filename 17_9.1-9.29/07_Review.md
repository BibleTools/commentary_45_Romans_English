# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. In the opening verses of Romans 9, Paul expresses his deep sorrow and anguish over the spiritual lostness of his fellow Israelites. What does this tell us about Paul's heart for his people, and his view of evangelism?
2. In verse 6, Paul asks, "But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel." What does Paul mean by this statement, and how does it relate to God's sovereign choice?
3. In verses 10-13, Paul references the stories of Isaac and Ishmael, and Jacob and Esau, to illustrate God's sovereign choice. What aspects of these stories help us to understand the nature of God's choice, and what implications do they have for us?
4. In verse 14, Paul anticipates the objection that God's choice is unfair or unjust. How does he respond to this objection, and what does his response tell us about the character of God?
5. Throughout this passage, Paul emphasizes God's sovereignty and the fact that he chooses whom he wills. How does this truth shape our understanding of salvation, and our approach to evangelism and mission?
6. In verses 22-23, Paul speaks of "vessels of wrath" and "vessels of mercy." What do these terms mean, and how do they relate to God's sovereign choice?
7. In verse 29, Paul quotes the prophet Isaiah to affirm that God's choice is not based on ethnicity or nationality, but on his own purposes and plans. How does this truth challenge our assumptions and biases, and motivate us to share the gospel with all people?
