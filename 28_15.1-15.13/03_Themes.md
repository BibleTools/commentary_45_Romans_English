# Themes

Romans 15:1-13 is a passage that encourages Christians to follow the example of Christ in their interactions with others. The key themes expressed in this passage include unity, love, and service.

Firstly, the passage emphasizes the importance of unity among believers. Christians are called to put aside their differences and work together for the common goal of spreading the Gospel. The passage urges Christians to accept one another, just as Christ has accepted them (verse 7). This means that Christians should not allow their individual preferences or opinions to divide them, but rather to focus on what unites them in Christ.

Secondly, the passage emphasizes the importance of love. Christians are called to love one another and to serve others in love. Christ is presented as the ultimate example of love and service, as He sacrificed Himself for the sake of others. Christians are called to follow His example by putting the needs of others before their own and by serving others in love.

Lastly, the passage emphasizes the theological implications of following Christ's example. By following Christ's example of unity, love, and service, Christians demonstrate the character of God to the world around them. They also contribute to God's plan for humanity by spreading the Gospel and building up the body of Christ.

Biblical Greek studies help us understand the depth of the word "accept" in verse 7. In the original Greek, the word used for "accept" means "to take to oneself" or "to receive with favor." This means that Christians are called to not only tolerate one another but to actively seek to welcome and embrace one another as Christ has welcomed and embraced them.

The message conveyed in this passage impacts our connection with God by reminding us of the importance of following Christ's example of unity, love, and service. By doing so, we demonstrate our love for God and our commitment to His plan for humanity. The Old Testament contributes to our comprehension of this passage by providing examples of unity and service, such as King David's service to Saul in 1 Samuel 16 and the unity of the Israelites under Moses' leadership in Exodus. These examples demonstrate the importance of following Christ's example of unity, love, and service in order to fulfill God's plan for humanity.
