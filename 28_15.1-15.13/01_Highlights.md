Romans 15:1-13 is a passage that encourages believers to follow the example of Christ in their interactions with others. The passage begins with a call to those who are strong in faith to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please themselves. This is followed by a reminder that even Christ did not please himself, but instead bore the reproaches of those who reviled him.

The passage goes on to explain that Christ's example was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. The hope that believers have is rooted in the promises of God, who has made provision for all people, both Jews and Gentiles, to be saved through faith in Christ.

In this passage, we see that the key words are "patience," "endurance," and "encouragement." These words are crucial to understanding the call to follow Christ's example. The passage emphasizes that believers must be patient with others, even when they have different beliefs or values. They must also endure in the face of persecution and suffering, just as Christ did. Finally, they must encourage one another through the Scriptures and the promises of God.

This passage relates to other passages in the Bible that emphasize the need for believers to follow Christ's example in their interactions with others. For example, in Philippians 2:5-8, believers are called to have the same mind as Christ, who humbled himself and became obedient even to death on a cross. Similarly, in 1 Peter 2:21-25, believers are called to follow in the footsteps of Christ, who suffered unjustly for the sake of others.

In summary, Romans 15:1-13 is a call to believers to follow the example of Christ in their interactions with others. This involves being patient, enduring in the face of suffering, and encouraging one another through the promises of God. By doing so, believers can have hope and be assured of their salvation through faith in Christ.
