# Devotion

Romans 15:1-13 teaches us about the importance of following the example of Christ in our relationships with others. The passage begins by calling us to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. In other words, we are called to put the needs of others before our own desires and to show compassion to those who may be struggling in their faith or in their personal lives.

This is not an easy task. It requires patience, humility, and a willingness to sacrifice our own comfort for the sake of others. But as Christians, we are called to imitate Christ, who gave up his own life out of love for us. We are called to follow his example of selflessness and to extend his love and grace to others.

The passage goes on to remind us that Christ did not come to please himself, but rather to serve others and to fulfill God's plan for salvation. As we seek to imitate Christ, we too must be willing to serve others and to live out God's plan for our lives.

One practical way we can do this is by seeking to build up our brothers and sisters in Christ. The passage reminds us that we should use our words and actions to encourage and strengthen one another, rather than tearing each other down. We should strive to create an atmosphere of love and unity within our communities of faith, just as Christ did for us.

Ultimately, the passage reminds us that our hope and joy come from God, who has given us his Holy Spirit to guide and empower us. As we follow the example of Christ and seek to serve others, we can trust that God will bless our efforts and use us to bring glory to his name.

In conclusion, let us strive to imitate the example of Christ in all of our relationships. Let us put the needs of others before our own desires, serve one another in love, and build up our communities of faith. May God give us the strength and wisdom we need to live out this calling, and may he be glorified in all that we do.

Let us pray:

Gracious and loving God, we come before you today to thank you for the example of Christ. He lived a life of selflessness, setting aside his own desires and needs to serve others. Help us to follow his example, Lord. Give us the strength and the courage to put aside our own wants and to look out for the needs of others, especially those who are weak and vulnerable.

May we be filled with your Holy Spirit, who gives us the power to live lives that honor you. May we embrace the principles of kindness and compassion, and may we love one another as Christ has loved us.

Thank you for the hope and joy that you give us through your Word. May we be filled with all joy and peace in believing, so that we may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. We pray this in Jesusâ€™ name, Amen.
