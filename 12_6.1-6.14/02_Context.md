# Context

The passage in Romans 6:1-14 speaks about the results of justification for Christians. To better understand its meaning in the context of the struggles of early Christians, we need to look at the historical and cultural background of the time.

During the time of Paul's writing, the Roman Empire was in power, and Christians faced persecution and discrimination from both the Jewish religious authorities and the Roman government. In addition, many Christians struggled with the concepts of sin and righteousness, and how to live a life that was pleasing to God.

In this passage, Paul is speaking directly to these issues, addressing the question of whether Christians should continue to sin in order to receive more grace. He emphatically answers, "By no means!" and goes on to explain that when we are baptized into Christ, we are united with him in his death and resurrection, and are no longer slaves to sin.

Paul paints a vivid picture of the old life of sin and the new life in Christ, using imagery of death and resurrection. He explains that just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too should walk in newness of life, no longer being controlled by sin but instead living in righteousness.

This passage speaks directly to the struggles that early Christians faced in trying to reconcile their old way of life with their new faith in Christ. Paul emphasizes that the old self has been crucified with Christ, and that we should no longer be slaves to sin but instead live a life that is pleasing to God.

Understanding the historical and cultural context of the time helps us to see how Paul's message would have been relevant and encouraging to early Christians. In a time when persecution and discrimination were common, Paul's message that they were no longer slaves to sin and death would have been a powerful reminder of their new identity in Christ. Additionally, Paul's emphasis on living a life of righteousness would have been a helpful guide to Christians struggling to find their way in a world that was often hostile to their faith.
