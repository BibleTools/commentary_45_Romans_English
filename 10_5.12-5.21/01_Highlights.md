Romans 5:12-21 compares and contrasts Adam, the first man, with Christ, the new man. The passage teaches that through Adam, sin came into the world, and through Christ, righteousness and life came into the world.

The passage begins by stating that sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and that sin spread to all people because all sinned. This means that because of Adam’s sin, all people inherited a sinful nature and are therefore separated from God. However, the passage also teaches that God’s grace is greater than sin, and that through Christ’s sacrifice, people can be reconciled to God.

The passage goes on to explain that just as Adam’s sin brought death and condemnation to all people, Christ’s obedience brings righteousness and life to all who receive it. This means that those who are in Christ are no longer under the power of sin and death, but are instead under the power of grace and life.

The passage concludes by emphasizing the supremacy of Christ over Adam. While Adam brought sin and death into the world, Christ brought righteousness and life. Through Christ, people can receive the gift of eternal life and be reconciled to God.

The key words and phrases used in this passage include sin, death, grace, righteousness, and life. These words contribute to the passage’s overall message that sin and death came through Adam, but grace and life come through Christ.

This passage relates to other passages in the Bible, such as Genesis 3:1-24, which tells the story of Adam and Eve’s sin in the garden. It also relates to John 3:16, which teaches that God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

In conclusion, Romans 5:12-21 teaches that Adam’s sin brought sin and death into the world, but Christ’s sacrifice brought righteousness and life. Through Christ, people can be reconciled to God and receive the gift of eternal life.
