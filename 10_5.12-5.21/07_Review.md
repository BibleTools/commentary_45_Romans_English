We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. In verses 12-14, Paul draws a parallel between Adam and Christ. What are some similarities and differences between the two?
2. Paul says that sin entered the world through Adam's disobedience. What is the significance of this in terms of our understanding of sin and its effects?
3. In verse 15, Paul contrasts the "trespass" of Adam with the "free gift" of Jesus Christ. What does this mean, and why is it important?
4. Paul says that "where sin increased, grace abounded all the more" (verse 20). What does this mean for us as Christians, and how should it impact our understanding of God's grace?
5. In verse 21, Paul says that "grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." How does this statement summarize the overall message of this passage, and what implications does it have for our lives as believers?
