Romans 14:1-12 teaches us about not judging others. In this passage, Paul urges believers to accept those who have weaker faith and not to judge them for their convictions or actions. Instead, he encourages us to welcome them and avoid causing them to stumble. 

The passage emphasizes that God is the ultimate judge and that each person will be held accountable for their own actions. Therefore, it is not our place to pass judgment on others. 

One insight that can be gained from examining the original Greek words in this passage is that the word translated as "judge" is "krino," which can also mean "condemn." This highlights the seriousness of passing judgment on others, as it can lead to condemnation. 

Key words and phrases in this passage include "weak in faith," "stumbling block," and "judgment seat of God." These words are important because they emphasize the need for humility and caution in our interactions with others. 

Furthermore, this passage relates to other passages in the Bible that emphasize the importance of loving our neighbors and treating others with respect and kindness. It also relates to the teachings of Jesus, who urged his followers to not judge others and to focus on their own shortcomings instead. 

In summary, Romans 14:1-12 teaches us about the importance of not judging others and the need for humility and caution in our interactions with those who may have weaker faith or different convictions.
