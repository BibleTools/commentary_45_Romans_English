# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. What is the significance of Paul's reference to Abraham as the father of faith? How does this relate to our own faith and beliefs?
2. In what ways did Abraham demonstrate his faith, according to this passage? How does his example challenge us as believers today?
3. Paul emphasizes that Abraham was justified by faith, not by works. What implications does this have for our understanding of salvation and righteousness?
4. How does Paul's argument in this passage address the tension between faith and law within the Jewish community? How might this be relevant for us as Christians today?
5. What role does the promise of God play in Abraham's story, and how does this relate to our own experiences of God's promises and blessings?
6. How does Paul use the example of Abraham to refute the idea that a person must be circumcised in order to be justified before God? What does this teach us about the inclusivity of God's salvation?
7. In verse 25, Paul affirms that Jesus was "delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification." How does this tie in with the themes of faith and righteousness that are explored in this passage? What does this mean for us as believers?
