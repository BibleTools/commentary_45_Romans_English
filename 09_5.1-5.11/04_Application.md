Romans 5:1-11 highlights the benefits of justification and how it impacts our lives. 

Verse 1 says, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." This means that by believing in Jesus Christ and accepting his sacrifice for our sins, we are made right with God, and our sins are forgiven. The result of this justification is a sense of peace knowing that we are no longer separated from God by our sins. We can now approach God with confidence in prayer and have a relationship with Him.

Verse 2 tells us that our justification also gives us access to God's grace, which is unmerited favor. We have confidence that God will provide for our needs and help us through difficult times.

In verses 3-5, we see that our justification gives us hope. We can rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that they produce perseverance, character, and ultimately, hope. We have the assurance that God is working all things together for our good, even in the midst of trials and hardships.

Verse 6-8 reminds us of the incredible love that God has for us. While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. This love is demonstrated in the fact that Christ died for us, even though we didn't deserve it. Our justification is a result of God's love and grace, and not because of anything we have done.

Verse 9 emphasizes the security that comes with our justification. We are saved from God's wrath through Jesus Christ, and we can be confident that we will be saved from future judgment as well.

Finally, in verses 10-11, we see that our justification also results in reconciliation with God. We were enemies of God because of our sin, but through Christ's death, we have been reconciled to God. We have peace with God, and we can now rejoice in our relationship with Him.

In summary, the benefits of justification include peace with God, access to His grace, hope in difficult times, assurance of His love and security, and reconciliation with God. These benefits are available to us through faith in Jesus Christ, and we can apply them to our lives by trusting in Him and seeking to live a life that honors Him.
