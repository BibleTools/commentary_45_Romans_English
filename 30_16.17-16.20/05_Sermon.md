# Sermon

Dear congregation,

Today, we will be looking at a passage from Romans 16:17-20, where Paul gives his final instructions and warnings to the church in Rome. This passage is particularly relevant for us today as we seek to live out our faith in a world that is increasingly hostile to the gospel.

Firstly, let's consider the context of the passage. Paul wrote this letter to the church in Rome, a community that was made up of both Jews and Gentiles. Paul was writing to instruct them on the gospel, and to encourage them to live out their faith in a way that would glorify God. In this passage, Paul is warning the church about false teachers who would seek to deceive them and lead them away from the truth.

What is the main message or theme of the passage? Paul is warning the church to be vigilant and to be on guard against false teaching. He urges them to avoid those who would cause division and to hold fast to the gospel message that they have received. He reminds them that God will soon crush Satan under their feet, and that they have the power to overcome any temptation or deception that may come their way.

So what is the message or lesson that we can take away from this passage? We must be vigilant and on guard against false teaching. It is all too easy to be led astray by false teachers who seem to offer an easy path to salvation. But we must hold fast to the gospel message that we have received, and we must avoid those who would cause division within the church.

How can we make this message relevant and applicable to our lives today? We live in a world that is filled with false teachings and deceptive messages. We must be discerning and careful about what we believe and who we listen to. We must also be vigilant in guarding our own hearts against the temptation to compromise our faith.

Are there any challenges or objections that someone might have to this message? Some might argue that we should be more open-minded and tolerant of other viewpoints. But we must remember that the gospel is a message of truth, and we cannot compromise on that truth. We must also remember that false teaching can lead people away from Christ, and we have a responsibility to ensure that we are not promoting deception in any way.

In conclusion, let us be vigilant and on guard against false teaching. Let us hold fast to the gospel message that we have received, and let us avoid those who would cause division within the church. Let us always be in prayer, seeking God's wisdom and guidance as we navigate the challenges of this world. And let us remember that God has already won the victory over Satan, and we have the power to overcome any temptation or deception that may come our way. Amen.
