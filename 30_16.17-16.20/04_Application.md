Romans 16:17-20 provides some final instructions and warnings to the believers in Rome. In these verses, Paul urges the Roman Christians to be aware of those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that they have been taught.

The passage begins with Paul instructing the believers to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles. These individuals are not serving the Lord, but are serving their own selfish desires. They use smooth words and flattery to deceive and mislead others. They are false teachers who seek to lead people away from the truth.

Paul reminds the believers that they have been taught the doctrine of Christ, and they must hold firm to it. They should not be swayed by the false teachings of these individuals. Those who persist in spreading false teachings should be avoided.

Paul then reassures the believers that God will soon crush Satan under their feet. This is a reminder that God is in control, and the believers can trust in His power to overcome the schemes of the devil.

So, how can we apply these teachings to our own lives? Firstly, we must be diligent in discerning the truth. We need to be aware of those who seek to lead us astray and not be deceived by their smooth words. We must hold fast to the teachings of Christ and avoid those who spread false doctrines.

Secondly, we must trust in God’s power to overcome the devil. We should not be afraid of those who seek to deceive us, for God is greater than any deception or temptation. We can rely on Him to guide us and protect us from harm.

Finally, we should be mindful of our own actions and teachings. We should strive to live according to the doctrine of Christ and avoid causing division or obstacles for others. We should seek to build up the body of Christ and not tear it down.

In summary, Romans 16:17-20 provides important instructions and warnings for believers. We must be discerning and hold fast to the truth, while trusting in God’s power to overcome the schemes of the devil. We should also be mindful of our own actions and seek to build up the body of Christ.
