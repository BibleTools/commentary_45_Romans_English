# Sermon

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

Today's reading comes from the book of Malachi, specifically chapter 3 verses 1-8. In this passage, we see a picture of God's faithfulness and man's unfaithfulness.

Firstly, let's look at the context of this passage. Malachi was a prophet sent by God to deliver a message to the people of Israel. The people had become complacent in their worship and were not giving God the honor and respect He deserved. They were also disobeying His commands and living in sin. Malachi's message was a call to repentance and a return to God.

In verse 1, we see a prophecy of the coming of the Messiah. The messenger who will prepare the way for the Lord is John the Baptist, as we learn in the New Testament. This is a reminder that God is faithful to His promises and that He always keeps His word.

Moving on to verses 2-6, we see God's response to the people's disobedience. He says that He will purify the Levites, the priestly tribe, and that He will judge those who practice sorcery, adultery, and dishonesty. This is a warning that God will not tolerate sin and that there will be consequences for our actions.

In verses 7-8, God calls out the people for their unfaithfulness. They were not giving their tithes and offerings as they were commanded to do. This is a reminder that we too must be faithful in our giving and in our obedience to God's commands.

What can we take away from this passage? Firstly, we can be assured of God's faithfulness to His promises. He sent His son, the Messiah, to save us from our sins. Secondly, we must be obedient to God's commands and be faithful in our worship and our giving. Lastly, we must repent of our sins and turn back to God, for He is gracious and merciful to those who seek Him.

Let us pray that God would give us the strength and the wisdom to follow His commands and to live lives that are pleasing to Him. May we always remember His faithfulness and strive to be faithful in return. Amen.
