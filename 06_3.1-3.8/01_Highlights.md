In this passage, Paul discusses the faithfulness of God and the unfaithfulness of man. He starts by asking whether there is any advantage to being a Jew or being circumcised, and then answers his own question by saying that the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. However, he points out that some of the Jews were unfaithful and didn't believe in God, but that doesn't mean God's faithfulness is nullified. He argues that even if everyone is unfaithful, it doesn't change God's faithfulness.

Paul then quotes from Psalm 51 to show that everyone is unfaithful and has sinned. He argues that everyone is under sin and that no one is righteous. He says that the law was given to show us our sinfulness, but it cannot save us. He emphasizes that we are justified by faith in Jesus Christ, not by works of the law.

Paul then anticipates the objection that some might have, namely, that if our unrighteousness shows God's righteousness, then why does God still punish us? He responds by saying that this is a human way of thinking and that God is righteous to judge the world. He argues that if our unrighteousness displays God's righteousness, then God is not unjust in punishing us.

In summary, Paul is emphasizing the faithfulness of God and the unfaithfulness of man. He argues that even if everyone is unfaithful, it doesn't change God's faithfulness. He also emphasizes that we are justified by faith in Jesus Christ, not by works of the law.
