# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today we gather together to reflect on the Word of God as we begin our journey through the book of Romans. As we embark on this spiritual journey, let us begin by turning to the first seven verses of Romans 1.

This passage begins with an introduction from Paul, clearly identifying himself and his purpose for writing this letter. He introduces himself as a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God. We can see that Paul's main focus is on the gospel of Christ, which he sees as the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.

Paul goes on to speak about the context of this letter - it is addressed to the Romans, a group of both Jews and Gentiles living in Rome at the time. He refers to them as beloved of God, called to be saints, and mentions that he desires to visit them to share the gospel and strengthen their faith.

In addition to this, Paul also highlights key theological themes that will be addressed throughout the book of Romans. He speaks of the righteousness of God, which is revealed through faith, and also mentions the importance of grace and peace from God and Jesus Christ.

As we delve deeper into the book of Romans, let us keep these themes and messages in mind. May we open our hearts and minds to the truth of God's Word, and may it transform us from the inside out. Let us pray for guidance and wisdom as we seek to understand and apply the teachings of this letter to our lives.

May God bless us and guide us as we journey together through the book of Romans. Amen.
