# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. In verse 1, Paul introduces himself as a "servant of Christ Jesus." What does it mean to be a servant of Christ Jesus? How does this title reflect Paul's identity and purpose?
2. Verse 2 mentions the "promised beforehand" gospel. What is the promised gospel and how does it connect to the Jewish faith?
3. In verse 3, Paul mentions Jesus' human nature and his divine nature. What is the significance of this duality? How does it relate to our understanding of Jesus' identity and his role in our salvation?
4. Verses 4-5 mention the resurrection and the grace that comes through Jesus. How do these concepts connect to the message of the gospel? How do they shape our understanding of our relationship with God?
5. In verse 7, Paul addresses the church in Rome and calls them "beloved of God, called to be saints." What does it mean to be called to be saints? How does this language reflect our identity as Christians?
