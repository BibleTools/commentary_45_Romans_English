# Devotion

Dear friends,

Today, let's take a moment to reflect on the opening verses of the book of Romans, specifically Romans 1:1-7. In this passage, we are introduced to the author of the book, the Apostle Paul, and his purpose for writing to the Roman church. 

Paul begins by introducing himself as a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God. He then goes on to explain that this gospel was promised beforehand through the prophets in the Holy Scriptures, and that it is about Jesus Christ, who was descended from David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead.

Through these verses, we can see that Paul is setting the stage for his message to the Romans. He wants to make it clear that he is not just sharing his own ideas, but rather he is sharing the gospel of God that has been prophesied about for centuries.

As we reflect on these verses, we can also see how they apply to our own lives. Just as Paul was called to be an apostle and proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ, we too are called to share the gospel in our own unique ways. We may not all be pastors or evangelists, but we can all be witnesses to the love and grace of God in our daily lives.

May we be inspired by Paul's example and always be ready to share the good news of Jesus Christ with those around us.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

We come before you today with grateful hearts, thanking you for the gift of your word and the message it contains. We thank you for the book of Romans and for the wisdom and guidance it provides.

As we reflect on the opening verses of this book, we are reminded of the devotion and dedication of the Apostle Paul. He was set apart for the gospel of God and committed to sharing the good news of Jesus Christ with all those he encountered.

We pray that we too would have that same devotion and dedication to your gospel. May we be willing to set ourselves apart for your purposes and to share the good news of Jesus Christ wherever we go.

We pray that you would give us a deeper understanding of the message of Romans and that we would be transformed by its truth. May we be inspired by the example of Paul and continue to grow in our faith and love for you.

We ask for your guidance and wisdom as we seek to live out your will in our lives. May we always be ready to share the good news of Jesus Christ with those around us and may many come to know you through our witness.

We pray all of this in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ.

Amen.
