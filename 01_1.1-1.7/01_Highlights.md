Romans 1:1-7 is the introduction to Paul's letter to the Romans. In this passage, Paul introduces himself as a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God. He states that the gospel was promised beforehand through the prophets in the Holy Scriptures and concerns Jesus Christ, who was descended from David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead.

Paul addresses his letter to the Romans, whom he describes as loved by God and called to be saints. He offers them grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul emphasizes that he desires to visit them so that he may impart to them some spiritual gift to strengthen them, but acknowledges that he has been hindered thus far.

The Greek words used in this passage provide insights into the importance of the gospel message to Paul. The word for "set apart" in verse 1 is "aphorizo", which means to mark off by boundaries, to separate or distinguish. This suggests that Paul is emphasizing the unique nature of his calling as an apostle and the importance of the gospel message he is preaching.

The phrase "according to the flesh" in verse 3 is "kata sarka", which highlights Jesus' human nature and lineage as a descendant of David. This is significant because it shows that Jesus was not only fully divine, but also fully human, which was essential for his role as a savior.

The phrase "according to the Spirit of holiness" in verse 4 is "kata pneuma hagiōsunēs", which emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in Jesus' resurrection and in declaring him to be the Son of God. This highlights the importance of the Holy Spirit in the Christian faith and the power it has to transform lives.

Overall, this passage sets the tone for Paul's letter to the Romans and emphasizes the importance of the gospel message and the role of Jesus Christ in it.
