Romans 13:1-7 is a passage that emphasizes the importance of submitting to authority. The passage starts by stating that every person should be subject to the governing authorities, as these authorities have been established by God. Those who resist these authorities are ultimately resisting God's appointed institutions and will face judgment. 

The passage goes on to explain that those in authority are God's servants, who are meant to protect the people and punish wrongdoers. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to authority not only to avoid punishment but also to maintain order and promote good behavior.

The passage also notes that those in authority are not perfect and may abuse their power. However, this does not justify rebellion or disobedience. Instead, individuals should seek to hold those in power accountable through proper legal channels.

The key words in this passage include "authority," "submit," "governing," and "punishment." These words emphasize the importance of recognizing and respecting the power of those in positions of authority.

This passage is related to other passages in the Bible that also emphasize submission to authority, such as 1 Peter 2:13-17 and Titus 3:1. Additionally, it is important to note that this passage must be read in its historical context, as the early Christians were living under Roman rule and faced persecution for their beliefs. As such, the passage can also be seen as a call for Christians to live peacefully within a society that may not always align with their beliefs.
