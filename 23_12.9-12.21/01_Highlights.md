Romans 12:9-21 speaks about love in action, outlining how believers can demonstrate their love for God and others through practical actions. The passage begins by urging believers to genuinely love others, to hate what is evil, and to cling to what is good. This love is to be expressed not only in words but also in actions, such as showing hospitality to strangers and blessing those who persecute them.

The passage goes on to emphasize the importance of unity among believers, encouraging them to live in harmony with one another and not to be proud but to associate with those who are lowly. It also instructs believers to overcome evil with good, rather than seeking revenge or harboring resentment. This includes being kind to enemies and caring for their needs.

The biblical Greek words used in this passage provide insights that aid our understanding. For example, the word "love" used in verse 9 is the Greek word "agape," which refers to a selfless, sacrificial love. This sheds light on the type of love that believers are called to demonstrate towards others. The word "hospitality" in verse 13 is the Greek word "philoxenia," which means showing love to strangers. This highlights the importance of welcoming and serving those we may not know or understand.

The key words and phrases used in this passage include "love," "hate what is evil," "cling to what is good," "harmony," "peace," "bless those who persecute you," "do not repay evil for evil," and "overcome evil with good." These words and phrases contribute to the passage's meaning by emphasizing the importance of actively demonstrating love towards others, even in difficult situations.

This passage also relates to other passages in the Bible, such as Jesus' command to love one's neighbor as oneself (Mark 12:31) and Paul's instruction to the Corinthians to "do everything in love" (1 Corinthians 16:14). It also connects with Jesus' teachings on forgiveness and turning the other cheek (Matthew 5:38-48). Overall, this passage serves as a practical guide for believers to live out their faith by demonstrating love in action.
