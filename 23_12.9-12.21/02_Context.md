# Context

Romans 12:9-21 is a passage that speaks to the struggles that early Christians faced in the time of its writing and provides guidance on how to live out love in action in the face of these challenges. The passage emphasizes the importance of genuine love, hospitality, empathy, and forgiveness in fostering unity within the Christian community and promoting peace with outsiders. 

In the historical context of the passage, Christians faced persecution and marginalization from both the Jewish and Roman authorities. Therefore, practicing love, empathy, and forgiveness was not only a matter of personal piety but also a strategic means of survival and resistance against the dominant cultural forces that sought to disintegrate the Christian community. 

Furthermore, the passage’s emphasis on hospitality was particularly significant in the first-century context where travel was often dangerous, and the concept of hotels was virtually nonexistent. Thus, offering hospitality to strangers was a way of providing basic needs such as food, shelter, and protection, and it was also a way of building trust and relationships with outsiders who might later become converts. 

The passage’s call for peaceful coexistence with outsiders was also revolutionary given the political climate of the time, where the Roman Empire maintained its authority through military force and intimidation. However, the early Christians were encouraged to “not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good” (Romans 12:21), indicating that love and forgiveness were more effective means of resisting oppression and promoting justice than violence or retaliation. 

Overall, understanding the historical and cultural context of Romans 12:9-21 enables us to appreciate the challenges that early Christians faced and the relevance of the passage’s teachings in our contemporary context. The passage challenges us to be mindful of the ways in which our actions and attitudes toward others can either promote unity and peace or perpetuate division and conflict.
