# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters,

Today we will be studying a passage from Romans 12:9-21. This passage is about love in action, and it gives us practical advice on how to live out our faith in our everyday lives.

First, let us consider the context of this passage. The Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the church in Rome, which was a diverse community of both Jews and Gentiles. Paul was writing to encourage them in their faith and to teach them how to live out their faith in their daily lives.

Now, let us turn to the passage itself. In verses 9 and 10, Paul tells us that love should be sincere and that we should honor one another. He also encourages us to be joyful, patient, and faithful in prayer. These are all practical ways in which we can show love to one another.

In verses 11-13, Paul tells us to be diligent in serving the Lord and to be hospitable to one another. He also reminds us to bless those who persecute us and not to repay evil for evil. This is a challenging message, but it is also a powerful one. When we show love to our enemies, we demonstrate the transformative power of Christ’s love.

In verses 14-16, Paul tells us to rejoice with those who rejoice and to weep with those who weep. He encourages us to live in harmony with one another and not to be proud or conceited. These are important qualities for any Christian community.

In verses 17-21, Paul tells us not to repay evil for evil but to overcome evil with good. He reminds us that vengeance belongs to the Lord and that we should leave judgment to him. This is a difficult message, but it is one that we need to hear. When we seek revenge, we only perpetuate the cycle of violence. But when we choose to show love and forgiveness, we break the cycle and open the door to healing and reconciliation.

So what is the message that we should take away from this passage? We should remember that love is not just a feeling, but it is also an action. We should strive to show love to one another in our daily lives, even when it is difficult. We should seek to live in peace with one another and to overcome evil with good.

As we go forth from this place, let us remember the words of Paul in Romans 12:21: “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” May we be filled with the love of Christ and may we show that love to everyone we meet.

Amen.
