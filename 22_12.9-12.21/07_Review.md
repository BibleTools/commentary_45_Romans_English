We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. In verse 9, Paul tells us to "let love be genuine." What does this mean to you, and how can we cultivate genuine love in our lives?
2. In verses 10-13, Paul gives us several practical examples of what genuine love looks like. Which of these examples do you find most challenging, and why?
3. In verse 14, Paul tells us to "bless those who persecute you." What does this mean to you, and how can we put this into practice in our daily lives?
4. In verses 15-16, Paul urges us to "rejoice with those who rejoice" and "weep with those who weep." What does this look like in practice, and why is it important?
5. In verse 17, Paul tells us not to "repay anyone evil for evil," but to "do what is honorable in the sight of all." Why is it so difficult to resist the temptation to retaliate when someone wrongs us, and how can we overcome this temptation?
6. In verses 18-21, Paul tells us to "live peaceably with all" and to overcome evil with good. What are some practical ways we can pursue peace and reconciliation in our relationships, and how can we be agents of positive change in a world filled with conflict and division?
