In Romans 14:13-23, the apostle Paul instructs the believers in Rome not to cause others to stumble by their actions or attitudes. He begins by stating that believers should not judge one another or look down on each other because of differences in opinions about food or holy days. Instead, they should accept one another as Christ has accepted them (v. 13).

Paul then emphasizes the importance of not causing others to stumble by what one eats or drinks. He acknowledges that all food is clean and that nothing is unclean in itself, but if someone believes certain food is unclean and eats it anyway, they are sinning (v. 14-15). Therefore, believers should not eat or drink anything that would cause a brother or sister to stumble or be offended (v. 20).

Paul also extends this principle beyond food and drink to include any behavior that might cause someone else to stumble, such as arguing over disputable matters (v. 1), or exercising their freedom in a way that offends a weaker brother (v. 15). He emphasizes that the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (v. 17).

The key message of this passage is that believers should prioritize the good of others over their own preferences and freedoms. They should not do anything that will cause a fellow believer to stumble or be led into sin. Instead, they should seek to build up and encourage one another in their walk with Christ.
