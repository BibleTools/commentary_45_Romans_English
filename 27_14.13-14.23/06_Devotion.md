# Devotion

Romans 14:13-23 is a passage that speaks to the importance of considering others in our actions and decisions. It encourages us to prioritize love and unity within the church community, even if it means setting aside our personal preferences or convictions.

As I reflect on this passage, I am reminded of times when I have been quick to judge others based on their choices or actions. It can be easy to become critical or self-righteous, especially when we feel strongly about something. However, this passage challenges us to approach others with humility and empathy, recognizing that everyone is on their own journey with God.

Paul writes, "Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister" (Romans 14:13 NIV). This means that we should be cautious not to do anything that might lead someone else to stumble in their faith, even if we personally believe it to be acceptable.

For example, if we know that someone struggles with alcoholism, we should avoid drinking alcohol around them to prevent them from being tempted. Or if we know that certain words or topics are offensive to someone, we should avoid using them in their presence.

Ultimately, this passage reminds us that we are called to love and serve others, putting their needs above our own. As we do so, we can create a community of grace and unity that honors God and reflects His love to the world.

Let us pray:

Loving God,

I come before you today with a heart filled with devotion and reverence. Your word reminds us to not cause others to stumble, and I pray, Lord, that you help me to always keep this in mind.

Help me to be mindful of the impact of my words and actions on others. May I never use my freedom in Christ to cause others to stumble or to cause them to turn away from you. Instead, may I always strive to build others up in love, peace and unity.

I pray for the Holy Spirit's guidance to help me discern between what is beneficial and what is not. May my life be a reflection of your love and grace, and may I always shine your light in a way that draws others closer to you.

In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
