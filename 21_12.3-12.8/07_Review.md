# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. Verse 3 talks about not thinking too highly of oneself, but rather "thinking with sober judgment." How can we apply this principle in our own lives?
2. Verse 4 says that "as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function," what does this mean? How can we apply this principle in our own lives and in our church?
3. In verse 6, Paul talks about different gifts that are given to different people for the common good. What are some examples of these gifts, and how can they be used to build up the church?
4. How can we encourage others to use their gifts to build up the church? How can we create a culture of support and encouragement for those who may be hesitant to share their gifts?
5. In verse 8, Paul talks about those who are "called to show mercy." How can we show mercy to others in our own lives and in our church? How can we make sure that we are not neglecting this important aspect of serving others?
6. How can we use our gifts, our resources, and our time to serve those in need in our communities, and how can we do so in a way that honors God and demonstrates His love to the world?
