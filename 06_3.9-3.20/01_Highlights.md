In Romans 3:9-20, the Apostle Paul presents a convincing argument that everyone is guilty before God. He begins by quoting various Old Testament passages that emphasize the universal depravity of humanity, noting that both Jews and Gentiles alike are under sin and that no one is righteous, not even one.

Paul then highlights the numerous sins that humans commit, including deceit, murder, cursing, and disobedience to God. He notes that their tongues are full of lies and that their actions are destructive and harmful to others. He concludes that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

The meaning of the biblical Greek words in this passage provides insights that aid our understanding. For example, the word translated as "sin" in this passage is the Greek word "hamartia," which means to miss the mark or fall short of a standard. This helps us understand that sin is not just about doing bad things, but also about failing to live up to God's perfect standard.

The key words and phrases used in this passage, such as "none righteous," "all have sinned," and "the whole world may be held accountable to God," emphasize the universal guilt of humanity before God. These words and phrases contribute to the passage's meaning by emphasizing that no one is exempt from sin and that all are deserving of judgment.

This passage relates to other passages in the Bible, both within the same book and in other books, which also emphasize humanity's fallen state and need for salvation through Christ. For example, Romans 6:23 states that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. This shows that while all are guilty before God, salvation is available through faith in Christ.
