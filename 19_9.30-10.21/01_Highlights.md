In Romans 9:30-10:21, the apostle Paul addresses the issue of Israel's unbelief. In this passage, Paul emphasizes that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, and not by following the law. He points out that the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have attained it through faith in Jesus Christ. However, Israel, who pursued righteousness through the law, did not attain it because they did not pursue it by faith.

Paul quotes from the Old Testament to demonstrate that God had always planned to offer salvation to the Gentiles, even before the time of Christ. He also emphasizes that salvation is available to all who call on the name of the Lord, regardless of their ethnic or social background.

Paul also recognizes that Israel's unbelief is not due to a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of faith. He points out that they have heard the message of salvation, but they have not all obeyed it. He also notes that Moses prophesied about Israel's unbelief, saying that they would stumble over the stumbling stone, which is Christ.

Paul concludes by emphasizing that faith in Christ is the only way to attain righteousness and salvation. He urges the Israelites to hear the message of salvation and to believe in their hearts and confess with their mouths that Jesus is Lord. He also reminds them that the Gentiles, who were once far from God, have now been brought near through faith in Christ.
