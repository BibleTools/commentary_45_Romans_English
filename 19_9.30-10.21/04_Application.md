In Romans 9:30-10:21, the Apostle Paul talks about Israel's unbelief and the reasons behind it. He begins by pointing out that the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have attained it, while Israel, who was pursuing righteousness, did not attain it because they sought it by works, not by faith (Romans 9:30-32). 

Paul then goes on to explain that it is not because God has rejected Israel, but because they have rejected Him. He quotes from the Old Testament to show that God has always been willing to accept those who come to Him in faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles (Romans 9:33-10:13). 

Paul also emphasizes the importance of preaching the gospel so that people can hear and believe. He reminds us that faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ (Romans 10:14-17). 

Furthermore, Paul explains that Israel's problem was not that they did not hear the gospel, but that they did not obey it. He says that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, because they did not submit to God's righteousness (Romans 10:18-21). 

So, what can we learn from this passage and apply to our own lives? First, we need to recognize that salvation is by faith, not by works. We cannot earn our way to heaven. We need to put our trust in Jesus Christ and believe in Him for salvation. 

Second, we need to share the gospel with others. People cannot believe in Jesus if they have never heard of Him. We need to be willing to tell others about the good news of salvation through faith in Christ. 

Third, we need to make sure that we are not only hearing the gospel, but also obeying it. It's not enough to know about Jesus; we need to follow Him and submit to God's righteousness. 

Finally, we need to have a heart for all people, whether they are Jews or Gentiles. God loves everyone and desires for all to be saved. We should pray for the salvation of those who do not yet believe and be willing to share the gospel with them when the opportunity arises.
