# Themes

Key Themes: 
1. The difference between faith and works: Paul emphasizes that no one can be justified by works of the law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. (Romans 9:30-33; 10:1-4) 
2. Israel's rejection of Jesus: Paul laments the fact that despite being God's chosen people, many Jews have rejected Jesus as the Messiah. (Romans 10:5-21) 
3. God's universal offer of salvation: Paul emphasizes that the message of salvation through faith in Jesus is for everyone, both Jews and Gentiles. (Romans 10:11-13) 

Biblical Greek Studies: 
1. The word for "righteousness" (dikaiosyne) in Romans 9:30-10:21 is a key term in Paul's letter to the Romans. In this context, it refers to the righteousness that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. 
2. The phrase "confess with your mouth" (homologeo en to stomati sou) in Romans 10:9 is significant because it emphasizes the importance of publicly acknowledging Jesus as Lord. 

Theological Implications: 
1. The importance of faith in Jesus: Paul emphasizes that salvation is not achieved through works of the law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. This means that Christians must put their trust in Jesus alone, not in their own good deeds. 
2. The tragedy of unbelief: Despite being God's chosen people, many Jews have rejected Jesus as the Messiah. This highlights the reality that even those who are close to God can still reject Him. 
3. God's inclusive love: Paul emphasizes that the message of salvation through faith in Jesus is for everyone, both Jews and Gentiles. This highlights the universal nature of God's love and grace. 

Connection with God: 
1. Trusting in Jesus: This passage emphasizes the importance of putting our trust in Jesus for salvation, rather than relying on our own good deeds. As we trust in Him, we can experience the peace and joy that comes from knowing we are saved by grace. 
2. Sharing the Gospel: As Christians, we have a responsibility to share the message of salvation through faith in Jesus with others. We can do this by confessing with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and by living out our faith in our daily lives. 
3. Loving all people: As Paul emphasizes the universal nature of God's love and grace, we are reminded that we should love all people, regardless of their background or beliefs. We should seek to share the message of salvation with everyone, just as God offers salvation to all who believe.
