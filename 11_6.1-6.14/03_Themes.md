# Themes

Romans 6:1-14 is a powerful passage about the results of justification through faith in Jesus Christ. There are several key themes expressed in this passage, including:

1. Freedom from sin - Paul begins by asking the rhetorical question, "Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?" (v. 1) He answers this question by saying, "By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?" (v. 2) The theme of freedom from sin is repeated throughout the passage as Paul explains that our old self was crucified with Christ and that we are now free from the power of sin (vv. 6-7).

2. New life in Christ - Paul emphasizes that we are not only freed from sin, but we are also given new life in Christ. He writes, "For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his" (v. 5). This new life is characterized by righteousness and obedience to God (vv. 11-12).

3. Death to self - Another key theme in this passage is the idea that we must die to ourselves in order to live for Christ. Paul writes, "Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus" (v. 11). This means that we must no longer live for our own desires and passions, but we must submit to Christ and live for his purposes.

Biblical Greek studies help us understand each of these themes in more depth. For example, the word "justification" (dikaiosis) in v. 1 is a legal term that means "to acquit" or "to declare righteous." Understanding this term helps us to see that our freedom from sin is not something we earn, but rather it is a gift that God gives us through Christ.

The theological implications of this passage are significant. It reminds us that our salvation is not just about being forgiven of our sins, but it is also about being transformed into the image of Christ. As we die to ourselves and live for Christ, we become more and more like him. This passage also reminds us that we have a responsibility to live in obedience to God, not out of obligation, but because we love him and want to honor him.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this passage in several ways. For example, Paul's reference to baptism (v. 3) is reminiscent of the Israelites passing through the Red Sea (Exodus 14-15). Both events signify a new beginning and a separation from the old way of life.

Finally, the message of this passage impacts our connection with God by reminding us that we are not slaves to sin, but we are children of God (v. 10). We can approach God with confidence and boldness, knowing that we have been justified and made righteous through faith in Christ.
