In Romans 6:1-14, Paul discusses the implications of being justified by faith in Christ. He starts by addressing a hypothetical objection that might arise: if we are justified by faith, then does that mean we can continue sinning? Paul emphatically answers no, because the believer has died to sin and now lives in Christ. 

Paul explains that through baptism, believers have been united with Christ in his death and resurrection. This means that the old self, which was dominated by sin, has been crucified and buried, and a new self has been raised up to live a new life in Christ. 

As a result, believers are no longer slaves to sin but are free to live righteously. They have been set free from sin's power, and sin no longer has dominion over them. They are now called to present themselves as instruments of righteousness to God, using their bodies and lives to serve him.

Paul emphasizes that this is not a license to sin, but rather an invitation to live in freedom from sin and in submission to God. He urges believers to consider themselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus, and to offer themselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life.

The key words and phrases in this passage include "justified by faith," "died to sin," "new self," "alive to God," and "instruments of righteousness." These words and phrases highlight the transformation that occurs in believers when they are justified by faith, and how their lives are now to be lived in service to God.

This passage relates to other passages in the Bible, particularly in Paul's other letters, where he emphasizes the importance of living a holy life and the transformative power of Christ's death and resurrection. Overall, this passage emphasizes the practical implications of being justified by faith, and how it should result in a life of righteousness and service to God.
