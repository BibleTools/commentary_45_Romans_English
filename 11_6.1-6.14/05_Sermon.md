# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today, we will be studying from the book of Romans chapter 6, verses 1 to 14, which talks about the results of justification. In this passage, the Apostle Paul is addressing the question of whether we should continue to sin so that grace may increase. Let us delve deeper into this passage and understand the message that Paul is conveying to us.

To understand this passage, it is essential to know the context in which it was written. Paul wrote this letter to the church in Rome, which was a mix of Jews and Gentiles. The primary goal of the letter was to explain the gospel of Jesus Christ and how it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.

In this passage, Paul starts by asking the rhetorical question, “Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?” This question was raised because some people thought that since they are saved by grace, they could sin as much as they wanted to, and God would forgive them. But Paul answers by saying that we died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?

The main message of this passage is that when we are justified by faith in Christ, we are united with him in his death and resurrection. Our old self is crucified with Christ, and we are raised to new life in him. Therefore, we must no longer be slaves to sin, but we should offer ourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life.

As believers in Christ, we must realize that sin no longer has power over us. We have been set free from the bondage of sin and death. We are now alive to God in Christ Jesus, and we should live our lives for him. This means that we should no longer allow sin to reign in our bodies, but we should present ourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life.

The message or lesson that we want to take away from this passage is that as believers in Christ, we are called to live holy and righteous lives. We must not allow sin to have dominion over our lives, but we should offer ourselves to God as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to him.

To make this sermon relevant and applicable to the lives of the congregation members, we can use personal experiences and stories to illustrate the importance of living a holy life. We can also talk about the challenges that we may face in resisting sin and how we can overcome them through prayer and relying on the Holy Spirit.

Some potential challenges or objections that someone might have to the message of this passage are that it is impossible to live a perfect life, and we will inevitably sin. However, we must remember that although we are not perfect, we are called to strive for holiness and righteousness. We must also remember that when we do sin, we have an advocate in Jesus Christ who intercedes for us with the Father.

In conclusion, this passage reminds us that as believers in Christ, we have been set free from the power of sin and death. We are now called to live for Christ and offer ourselves to God as living sacrifices. May we be empowered by the Holy Spirit to live holy and righteous lives that bring glory to God.

Amen.
