In Romans 6:1-14, the apostle Paul discusses the results of justification, which is the act of God declaring a sinner righteous and free from the penalty of sin through faith in Jesus Christ. While justification is a one-time event, it has ongoing implications for the believer's life.

One of the primary results of justification is that the believer is no longer enslaved to sin. Paul says in verses 2-7 that "we who died to sin [through faith in Christ] live no longer in it" and that "our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin" (v. 6). This means that we have been set free from the power of sin and have the ability to resist temptation and choose righteousness.

Another result of justification is that the believer is now alive to God. In verse 11, Paul says, "In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus." This means that we have a new spiritual life in Christ, which empowers us to live a life that is pleasing to God.

As a result of our new life in Christ, we are called to offer ourselves to God as instruments of righteousness (v.13). This means that we are to live in obedience to God and use our bodies and minds to serve Him. As believers, we are no longer under the law but under grace (v. 14), which means that our obedience is motivated by love and gratitude for what Christ has done for us, rather than a desire to earn salvation.

In summary, the results of justification include freedom from the power of sin, a new life in Christ, and a call to live in obedience to God. These results are ongoing and require a daily surrender to the Holy Spirit's work in our lives. As we walk in faith and obedience, we experience the fullness of the abundant life that Christ has promised us.
