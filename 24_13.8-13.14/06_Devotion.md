# Devotion

Romans 13:8-14 says, "Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, 'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,' and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

This passage is a powerful reminder of the importance of love in our lives. As followers of Christ, we are called to love one another as He has loved us. Love is not just a feeling, but it is an action that we must actively choose to demonstrate towards others.

The passage goes on to say that the commandments are summed up in the word "love." If we truly love our neighbor as ourselves, we will not commit any of the sins listed in the passage above. It is clear that love is not just a suggestion, but it is a commandment that we are called to obey.

As I reflect on this passage, I am reminded of the times when I have failed to love others as I should. There have been times when I have spoken harshly to someone, or when I have been quick to judge without truly understanding their perspective. But this passage reminds me that when I choose to love, I am fulfilling the law.

God is calling us to love those around us, even when it is difficult. Love is not always easy, but it is always worth it. When we choose to love, we are fulfilling our purpose as followers of Christ.

So, let us make a commitment today to love those around us. Let us be intentional in our actions and choose to love even when it is hard. Let us remember that love is the fulfilling of the law, and it is through love that we can make a difference in the world around us.

Let us pray:

Heavenly Father,

As we come before You today, we are reminded of the truth that love fulfills the law. Help us to understand this more deeply and to live it out in our daily lives.

Lord, we ask that You would fill us with Your love, so that we may love others as You have loved us. Help us to remember that every person we encounter is created in Your image and is deserving of love and respect.

We pray that our love would be genuine and selfless, not seeking anything in return. May our love be a reflection of Your perfect love, which is sacrificial and unconditional.

Father, we ask that You would help us to obey Your commandments and to live in a way that honors You. Give us the strength and courage to resist temptation and to flee from sin.

As we seek to fulfill the law through love, may our lives be a testimony to Your grace and goodness. We pray all these things in the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.
