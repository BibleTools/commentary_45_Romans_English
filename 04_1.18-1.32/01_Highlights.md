In Romans 1:18-32, Paul explains that the guilt of the Gentiles is evidenced by their suppression of the truth about God's existence and power. Despite this knowledge being readily available through creation, they chose to worship idols and engage in immoral behavior.

The meaning of the biblical Greek words used in this passage provides insights that aid our understanding. For example, the word translated as "suppress" (katecho) in verse 18 implies an active effort to hold down or restrain the truth. This suggests that the Gentiles were not simply ignorant of God's existence, but actively chose to deny it.

Key words and phrases used in this passage include "exchange the truth of God for a lie" (v. 25), "God gave them over" (vv. 24, 26, 28), and "they did not see fit to acknowledge God" (v. 28). These phrases emphasize the Gentiles' rejection of God and the consequences that follow.

This passage also relates to other passages in the Bible, such as Psalm 19:1-6, which speaks of creation as a witness to God's existence and glory. Additionally, Paul's description of sinful behavior in verses 29-31 echoes the list of vices found in Galatians 5:19-21.

In summary, Romans 1:18-32 reveals the guilt of the Gentiles for suppressing the truth about God and engaging in immoral behavior. The passage highlights the consequences of this rejection and emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and honoring God as the Creator and Lord of all.
