Romans 1:18-32 is a powerful passage that speaks about the guilt of Gentiles before God. This passage highlights the fact that people who do not know God are still accountable for their actions, and that their ignorance does not excuse their sin. In this passage, Paul describes how the Gentiles have rejected the truth of God, despite the evidence of creation all around them.

The passage begins by saying that the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of humanity, who suppress the truth by their wickedness. The Gentiles, in particular, are without excuse because they have rejected the knowledge of God that has been made clear to them through creation.

Paul goes on to describe how the Gentiles have exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal humans and animals. They have worshiped these created things instead of the Creator, and as a result, they have been given over to the sinful desires of their hearts. They have engaged in all sorts of wickedness, including sexual immorality, greed, envy, murder, deceit, and gossip.

The passage concludes by stating that the Gentiles not only practice these sins themselves, but they also approve of those who do them. This means that they not only fail to resist temptation, but they also encourage others to engage in sinful behavior as well.

So how can we apply this passage to our own lives? Firstly, we can recognize the importance of acknowledging God's existence and power in our lives. We should not be like the Gentiles who reject God and worship created things instead. Instead, we should seek to know God and follow His ways.

Secondly, we can strive to resist temptation and avoid engaging in sinful behavior ourselves. We should not be like the Gentiles who have given themselves over to their sinful desires. Rather, we should seek to live a life that is pleasing to God and in line with His teachings.

Finally, we can also seek to be a positive influence on others and discourage them from engaging in sinful behavior. We should not be like the Gentiles who approve of those who do evil. Instead, we should seek to be a light in the world and encourage others to live a life that is pleasing to God.

In summary, Romans 1:18-32 reminds us that even those who do not know God are still accountable for their actions. We should seek to know God, resist temptation, and be a positive influence on those around us.
