# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. What does it mean to “stumble” in this context (verse 13)? Why is it important to avoid causing others to stumble?
2. According to verse 14, what are some examples of things that are not inherently sinful, but can become problematic in certain contexts? How can we determine whether something is a stumbling block for others?
3. In verses 15-16, Paul emphasizes the importance of not letting our actions cause harm to another person’s spiritual journey. How might our actions (even if they are not inherently sinful) negatively impact someone else’s faith?
4. According to verses 17-18, what should be our ultimate goal as Christians? How does this relate to the idea of not causing others to stumble?
5. In verses 19-20, Paul urges us to prioritize peace and building up our brothers and sisters in Christ. What are some practical ways we can do this in our interactions with others?
6. In verse 21, Paul warns against prioritizing our own desires over the well-being of others. Why might this be harmful to our witness as Christians?
7. Finally, in verse 23, Paul reminds us that anything that is not done in faith is sin. How might this impact our decision-making, particularly when it comes to causing others to stumble?
