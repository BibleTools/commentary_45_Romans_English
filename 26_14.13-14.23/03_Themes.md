# Themes

The passage of Romans 14:13-23 advocates for the importance of not causing others to stumble in their faith. It highlights the need for each individual to respect and honor the convictions of their fellow believers, even if they may not agree with them. 

One of the key themes expressed in this passage is that of Christian unity. The passage emphasizes that Christians should avoid causing division over disputable matters and instead focus on building up one another in faith. Paul encourages believers to "pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding" (Romans 14:19).

Another important theme in this passage is that of conscience. Paul stresses the importance of following one's own conscience in matters of faith, while also being careful not to judge or condemn others who may have different convictions. He reminds us that we will all stand before God to give an account for our actions (Romans 14:10-12).

Biblical Greek studies help us understand that the word used for "stumble" in this passage is skandalon, which can also be translated as "offense" or "trap." This highlights the seriousness of causing someone to stumble in their faith, as it could potentially lead them away from God.

In terms of theological implications, this passage reminds us that our actions have a direct impact on those around us, particularly our fellow believers. It also emphasizes the importance of humility and respect in our interactions with others, even when we may strongly disagree with them.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this passage by providing examples of individuals who caused others to stumble, such as Jeroboam who led the people of Israel into idolatry (1 Kings 12:25-33). This serves as a warning to us to be careful not to lead others astray in our own convictions.

Overall, the message conveyed in this passage is that we should strive to live in harmony with one another and avoid causing others to stumble in their faith. By doing so, we can build up the body of Christ and bring glory to God.
