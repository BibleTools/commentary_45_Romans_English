# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters,

Today, I want to bring our attention to the book of Romans, more specifically, the Benediction found in chapter 16, verses 25-27.

First, let us remember the context of the passage. The book of Romans was written by the Apostle Paul to the Christians in Rome. He wrote to them to explain the Gospel and how it is applicable to all people, Jews and Gentiles alike. In this final chapter, Paul concludes his letter by greeting and thanking various members of the church.

Now, let us focus on the Benediction itself. In these verses, Paul offers a beautiful prayer of praise to God. He acknowledges that God is able to strengthen us according to the Gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ. He declares that this Gospel, which was once hidden but is now revealed, has been made known to all the nations for the obedience of faith.

The main message of this passage is that God is worthy of all praise and glory. It is through the Gospel that we have been saved and it is only through the power of God that we are able to live a life of faith and obedience. This message is not only relevant to the Christians in Rome during Paul’s time but also to us today.

As we reflect on this passage, I want to encourage each one of us to live a life of praise and obedience to God. Let us remember that it is only through the Gospel that we have been saved, and it is only through God’s power that we are able to live a life that pleases Him. May we always give thanks to Him and acknowledge His greatness.

In conclusion, let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your Gospel and for the grace that You have given us through it. We acknowledge Your greatness and power, and we ask that You strengthen us according to Your Word. May we always live a life of faith and obedience, giving You all the praise and glory. We pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you always.

God bless you.
