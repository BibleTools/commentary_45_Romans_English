In Romans 6:15-23, Paul discusses the concept of being slaves of righteousness. He begins by asking a rhetorical question, "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? May it never be!" (Romans 6:15). Paul is making the point that just because we have been saved by grace, we should not use that as an excuse to continue living in sin.

He goes on to explain that when we were baptized into Christ, we were baptized into his death, and we were buried with him so that we might also walk in newness of life (Romans 6:3-4). This new life is one of righteousness, as Paul explains in verse 18: "And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness."

Paul contrasts being a slave to sin with being a slave to righteousness. He explains that when we were slaves to sin, we were free in regard to righteousness, meaning that we did not have to worry about doing what was right because we were only concerned with fulfilling our sinful desires. But now that we have become slaves of righteousness, we are free in regard to sin, meaning that sin no longer has control over us.

Furthermore, Paul explains that the end result of being a slave to sin is death, but the end result of being a slave to righteousness is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23).

In understanding the biblical Greek words used in this passage, we can gain further insights into the meaning of the text. For example, the word translated as "slaves" in verse 18 is the Greek word doulos, which means a bondservant or someone who is in a permanent position of servitude. This helps us understand that being a slave of righteousness is not just a temporary state, but a permanent one in which we are completely devoted to serving God.

Overall, this passage emphasizes the importance of living a righteous life as a response to God's grace. We are no longer slaves to sin, but rather slaves to righteousness, and our ultimate goal is eternal life in Christ.
