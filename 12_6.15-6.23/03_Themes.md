Romans 6:15-23 is a significant passage in the New Testament that talks about the concept of being slaves to righteousness. The passage highlights the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God as opposed to living in sin. The following are the key themes expressed in this passage:

1. Freedom from sin: In verses 15-18, Paul emphasizes that believers have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. This means that they have a new identity in Christ and are no longer bound by the power of sin.

2. The consequences of sin: In verses 19-21, Paul reminds us that sin leads to death, while living a righteous life leads to eternal life. He emphasizes that the wages of sin are death, and that sin ultimately leads to destruction. 

3. The gift of eternal life: In verse 23, Paul states that the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. This gift is not something that we can earn or achieve through our own efforts but is given freely to those who believe in Jesus Christ.

Understanding the original biblical Greek words used in this passage can help us to further understand the themes expressed. For example, the word for "slaves" is doulos, which means "bondservant," implying a willing submission to Christ as our master. This submission is not forced upon us, but out of gratitude for what Christ has done for us.

The theological implications of this passage are significant. It teaches us that we are saved by grace through faith in Christ alone and that our salvation leads to a life of obedience and righteousness. It also emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and the consequences of sin. 

The Old Testament also contributes to our understanding of this passage. For example, in Deuteronomy 30:19-20, Moses encourages the Israelites to choose life and blessings by obeying God's commands. The book of Proverbs also teaches that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and that living a righteous life leads to life and prosperity.

In conclusion, Romans 6:15-23 teaches us that as believers, we have been set free from sin and are now slaves to righteousness. It emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and the consequences of sin. Our understanding of this passage should lead to a deeper connection with God as we seek to live a life that honors Him.
