# Devotion

Romans 6:15-23 is a powerful passage that speaks about the freedom we have in Christ. The passage tells us that although we were once slaves to sin, we are now slaves to righteousness because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

As we reflect on this passage, we are reminded of the great love that God has for us. He created us in His image, but sin entered the world and separated us from Him. However, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, we are once again reconciled to God and given the opportunity to live a life devoted to Him.

In verse 16, Paul asks, "Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?" This means that we have a choice to make - we can either continue to live in sin and be slaves to it, or we can choose to live a life of obedience and be slaves to righteousness.

Being a slave to righteousness means that we allow the Holy Spirit to guide us and transform us into the image of Christ. We are no longer bound by the desires of our flesh, but we are instead filled with the fruit of the Spirit - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

As we think about our own lives, we are reminded that we are not perfect, and we often fall short of what God desires for us. However, the good news is that we have been given the gift of grace through Jesus Christ. This means that we have the opportunity to repent and turn away from our sin, and choose to live a life dedicated to God.

So, let us take a moment to reflect on our own lives. Are we living as slaves to sin or as slaves to righteousness? Are we allowing the Holy Spirit to guide us and transform us, or are we living according to our own desires? Let us choose to live a life of obedience and dedication to God, and allow Him to bring forth His righteousness in us.

Let us pray:

Dear Lord,

We come before You today humbled by Your love and grace. We thank You for Your Word, which speaks truth into our lives and guides us on the path of righteousness. As we reflect on Romans 6:15-23, we are reminded of the freedom we have in Christ.

We confess that we have often been slaves to sin, allowing our fleshly desires to lead us astray. But we know that through Jesus Christ, we have been given the opportunity to be slaves to righteousness. We ask that You would help us to choose this path, to turn away from our sin and instead live a life of obedience to You.

We pray that You would fill us with Your Holy Spirit, guiding us and transforming us into the image of Christ. May we bear the fruit of the Spirit in our lives, and may others see Your love and grace through us. Help us to resist the temptations of the world and to instead focus on the eternal life we have in You.

Thank You for the gift of grace, which allows us to repent and turn away from our sin. We pray that You would help us to receive this gift with open hearts and to live in the freedom that comes from being slaves to righteousness.

We pray all of this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen.
