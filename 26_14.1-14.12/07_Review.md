# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. What does Paul mean by "weak in faith" and "strong in faith" in this passage? How might this relate to our own experiences of faith and belief?
2. Why does Paul argue that we should not judge others who have different beliefs or practices than we do? What might be the negative consequences of judging others based on their faith?
3. How can we balance the freedom and responsibility we have as individuals to make our own choices about faith and practice with the need to respect and love our brothers and sisters in Christ?
4. In what ways might cultural or social differences impact our perceptions of faith and practice? How can we break down these barriers to unity and understanding in our own communities?
5. What does it mean to "give account of oneself to God" (verse 12)? How might this impact our interactions with others who hold different beliefs or practices than we do?
